For you are the rock on which I stand,
And you are the friend who holds my hand,
And you are the bright morning star,
The light in my darkest hour.
#1
I will seek you with all of my heart,
I will trust you with all of my life,
I will hope in all that you say,
For you are my Lord.
I will give you my hopes and my dreams,
I will fix my thoughts on your word,
I will speak of all you have done for me,
For you are my Lord.
