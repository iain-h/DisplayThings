This love, this hope,
This peace of God, this righteousness,
This faith, this joy,
This life complete in me.
#2
Now healed and whole,
And risen in His righteousness,
I live in Him,
He lives in me,
And filled with this hope in God,
Reflecting His glory.
#3
Now is the time to worship You,
Now is the time to offer You
All of my thoughts, my dreams and plans;
I lay it down.
Now is the time to live for You,
Now is the time I'm found in You.
Now is the time Your kingdom comes.
