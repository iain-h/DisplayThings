Hear our cry (hear our cry),
O Lord (O Lord),
Be merciful (be merciful)
Once more (once more).
Let your love (let your love)
Your anger stem (your anger stem),
Remember mercy, O Lord, again.

Your mercy flows upon us like a river.
Your mercy stands unshakable and true.
Most holy God, of all good things the giver,
We turn and lift our fervent prayer to you.
#2
Your Church once great, though standing 	clothed in sorrow,
Is even still the bride that you adore;
Revive your church, that we again may honour
Our God and King, our Master and our Lord.
#3
As we have slept, this nation has been taken
By every sin we have ever known,
So at its gates, though burnt by fire and broken,
In Jesus' name we come to take our stand.
