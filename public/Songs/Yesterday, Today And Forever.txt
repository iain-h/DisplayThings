Let's sing our praise to the Lord,
Thank You for the great things You have done.
Let's sing with all of our hearts,
There's no Father like You.
Let's dance for joy to the Lord,
For You have washed our sins away.
We're more than conquerors,
With You close by our side.
#1
Yesterday, Today And Forever
You're the same,
All the promises of God
Find their 'yes' in You.
Demons flee, strongholds fall,
They must bow before Your name,
No authority, no power is higher than You.
#2
Yesterday, today and forever
You're the same,
We need never fear
To put all our trust in You.
For Your word is a rock
And a light to show the way,
And a sword that will pierce
Through the darkness each day.
