No one could ever earn your love,
Your grace and mercy is free.
Lord, these words are true,
So is my love for you.
#1
Overwhelmed by love,
Deeper than oceans,
High as the heavens.
Ever-living God,
Your love has rescued me.
#2
All my sin was laid
On your dear Son,
Your precious One.
All my debt he paid,
Great is your love for me.
