Jesus, You are my treasure;
Jesus, nothing less will do.
Jesus, I am Yours forever;
Jesus, I want to live for You.
#1
I Give My Heart To What I Treasure;
My devotion, everything I am.
Like a diamond, You treat me like I'm precious;
To be Yours is more than I deserve.
#2
We are a people holy to our Saviour;
For this moment He has gathered us
To bring hope and healing to the nations,
Till His name is known in all the earth.
