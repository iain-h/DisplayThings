I delight greatly in the Lord,
My soul rejoices in my God.
I delight greatly in the Lord,
My soul rejoices in my God.
For He has clothed me with garments of salvation,
And arrayed me in a robe of righteousness.
He has clothed me with garments of salvation,
And arrayed me in a robe of righteousness.
