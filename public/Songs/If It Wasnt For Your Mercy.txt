And yet I find myself again
Where even angels fear to tread,
Where I would never dare to come,
But for the cleansing of Your blood.
#1
If It Wasn't For Your Mercy,
If it wasn't for Your love,
If it wasn't for Your kindness,
How could I stand?
#2
If it wasn't for Your cleansing,
If it wasn't for Your blood,
If it wasn't for Your goodness,
How could I stand?
#3
With You there is forgiveness,
And therefore You are feared.
Jesus, it's Your loving kindness
That brings me to my knees.
#4
In the beauty of Your holiness. (x4)
