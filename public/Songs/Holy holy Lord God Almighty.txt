Holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
Who was and who is and is to come.
Holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
Who was and who is and is to come.
All the angels cry, 'Holy',
All the angels cry, 'Holy',
All the angels cry, 'Holy is your name.'
Holy is your name. Holy is your name.
Holy is your name. Holy is your name.
