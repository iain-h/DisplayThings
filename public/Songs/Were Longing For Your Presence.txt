We're Longing For Your Presence, (Men - women echo)
We're waiting on Your promise,
That You will flood the nation
With mercy and with justice.
We've tasted of Your goodness,
We've waded in Your river,
Yet still the streets are deserts,
And men cry out in hunger.
Let sinners find forgiveness,
The lonely find a family;
Cause lips that mock and curse You
To sing of Your salvation.
#1
(All)
Open the heavens and come down.
Come in Your glory and Your power.
Send Your revival rain:
Replenish this land again!
Open the heavens and come down,
Come down!
#2
We want a way of living (Men - women echo)
That ushers in Your kingdom:
Faith, purity and passion,
And love without condition.
Come shake the ground on which we stand,
Till all we need is found in You;
Then pour the fire into our hearts
To do the work that You would do.
#3
(All)
Open the heavens and come down.
Come in Your glory and Your power.
Send Your revival rain:
Replenish this heart again!
Open the heavens and come down,
Come down!
