I love your presence, Jesus;
I love your presence, beloved Lord.
I love your presence, Jesus;
I love your presence, beloved Lord.
#1
I know your love is here, powerful and real;
Yes, your love is here, with the grace to heal.
I know your love is here, flowing from Calvary;
Yes, your love is here, stirring faith in me.
#2
Your Holy Spirit's here, mighty Counsellor;
Yes, your Spirit's here, with releasing pow'r.
Your Holy Spirit's here, poured out from above;
Yes, your Spirit's here, showing Father's love.
