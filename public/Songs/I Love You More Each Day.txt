I Love You More Each Day,
With all my heart can give;
Worship at Your feet,
Lost within Your gaze.
Just to know that You're near,
My treasure is here,
That You gave Your life
To save me;
How my heart sings with praise
And calls on Your name,
My Saviour, my Lover, my King,
Come to me again!
