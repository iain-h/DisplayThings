Glory to God in the highest,
And on the earth all peace from heav'n!
Glory to God in the highest,
And on the earth all peace from heav'n!
#1
Tonight, while all the world was sleeping,
A light exploded in the skies.
And then, as glory did surround us,
A voice, an angel did appear!
#2
Afraid, we covered up our faces,
Amazed at what our ears did hear.
Good news of joy for all the people û
Today a Saviour has appeared!
#3
And so to Bethlehem
To find it all was true;
Despised and worthless shepherds,
We were the first to know.
