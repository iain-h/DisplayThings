You're wonderful, You're marvellous,
You're everything to me.
Your steadfast and unchanging love
Are all I'll ever need.
What peace and what security
Can be found in knowing You,
My Healer, Deliverer.
#1
Again and again,
You have revealed Your love to me.
Again and again grace has shone through.
You've always been there for me
When I have come to You:
You are the Rock on which I stand.
#2
There is no limit to this never-ending stream
That's entered the castle of my soul.
You give me a hope and future
Beyond my wildest dreams.
Your love is greater than I know.
#3
You've been my fortress
Through the shifting sands of time;
In change and adversity
You have answered my prayer to guide me.
