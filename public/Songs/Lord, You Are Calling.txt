Let Your kingdom come,
Let Your will be done
On earth as it is in heaven.
(Repeat)
#1
Lord, You are calling the people of Your kingdom
To battle in Your name against the enemy;
To stand before You, a people who will serve You,
Till Your kingdom is released throughout the earth.
#2
At the name of Jesus every knee must bow;
The darkness of this age must flee away.
Release Your power to flow throughout the land;
Let Your glory be revealed as we praise.
