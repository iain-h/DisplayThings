Heal our nation,
Heal our nation,
Heal our nation,
Pour out Your Spirit on this land.
#1
Lord, we long for You to move in power;
There's a hunger deep within our hearts,
To see healing in our nation.
Send Your Spirit to revive us:
#2
Lord we hear Your Spirit, coming closer,
A mighty wave to break upon our land,
Bringing justice, and forgiveness.
God we cry to You, 'Revive us':
