What a faithful God have I
What a faithful God
What a faithful God have I
Faithful in every way
#1
Lord, I come before your throne of grace
I find rest in your presence
And fullness of joy
In worship and wonder
I behold your face
Singing what a faithful God have I
#2
Lord of mercy, you have heard my cry
Through the storm you're the beacon
My song in the night
In the shelter of your wings
Hear my heart's reply
Singing what a faithful God have I
#3
Lord all sovereign, granting peace from heaven
Let me comfort those who suffer
With the comfort you have given
I will tell of your great love for as long as I live
Singing what a faithful God have I
