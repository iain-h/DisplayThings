I am blessed, blessed to be a blessing,
I am blessed, I live under an open heaven,
Blessed, that all may see
It's Christ, Christ in me.
(Repeat)
#1
I Will Enter Your House with thanksgiving,
I will sing of Your goodness to me.
For my heart is eternally grateful,
I am blessed abundantly.
#2
You have given me life in all its fullness,
And joy no words can describe.
But I know it's for more than me,
It's for those, those You sent me to reach.
