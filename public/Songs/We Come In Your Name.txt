You have been lifted to the highest place,
And You now live and rule forever.
We come to bring You the highest praise,
For You are King of kings forever:
Son of God, Jesus!
#1
We Come In Your Name,
For all things You have made,
And by Your word all things You sustain.
The Lamb that was slain
For our sins lives to reign,
The Lord of all, Name above all names.
#2
We have been saved by faith
Into Your glorious name,
And this is a gift of God, freely given us.
Now all our sins are gone,
Defeated at the cross,
And we now live in You,
Raised with You by the power of God.
#3
Holy is the Lamb,
Worthy of glory, worthy of honour.
High and lifted up,
And seated in majesty,
Your throne will last forever (more).
(Repeat)
