Do Not Be Afraid,
For I have redeemed you.
I have called you by your name;
You are Mine.
#1
When you walk through the waters I'll be with you;
You will never sink beneath the waves.
#2
When the fire is burning all around you,
You will never be consumed by the flames.
#3
When the fear of loneliness is looming,
Then remember I am at your side.
#4
When you dwell in the exile of the stranger,
Remember you are precious in My eyes.
#5
You are Mine, O My child; I am your Father,
And I love you with a perfect love.
