And let Your glory shine,
O let Your glory shine.
O let Your glory shine
Through our lives, by Your grace,
May we overflow with Jesus.
#1
We Have This Treasure In Jars Of Clay.
For all our frailty, You have entrusted us
To shine Your goodness
And life throughout the nations.
We may be pressed hard from every side,
But we will not be crushed,
Your hope will strengthen us.
And when the hard times squeeze so tight,
May they release more
Of the fragrance of Jesus.
#2
May we shine like, may we shine like,
May we shine like stars in the darkness.
May we shine like, may we shine like,
May we shine like stars.
