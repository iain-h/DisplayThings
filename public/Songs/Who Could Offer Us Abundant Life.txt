(It's) only Jesus
Shines like the sun.
Only Jesus,
The King of kings, the Holy One.
(It's) only Jesus,
The Son of God, the Son of Man.
Only Jesus,
The Prince of Peace, the great I Am.

Who Could Offer Us Abundant Life?
Who could be the only way?
Who could be the purest sacrifice?
Who could have the power
To rise from the grave?
#2
Who could be our only righteousness?
Who could be the One who saves?
Who could be the God who became flesh?
Who could have the Name above every name?
#3
Who could give us living water?
Who could be the Bread of Life?
Who could overcome the darkness?
Who could be the Truth, our shining light?
#4
Now only I can offer up my life;
There's nothing less that I could give
To Him who gave up all His heavenly rights
So that I might live.
