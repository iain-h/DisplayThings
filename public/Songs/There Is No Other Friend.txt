There is no other friend,
There is no other friend like You, O Lord;
No other brother, no other sister like You.
There is no other love,
There is no other love like You, O Lord;
No other sweeter, no other fountain but You.
#2
How long until I'm satisfied?
I must have more of You.
For I was born in Zion,
Awakened love is crying out for You.
Lord, it must be You!
#3
If I am healed by just one touch of Your garment, Lord,
Then how much more of Your love is for me
Than I'm tasting, Lord?
Draw me, take me, I will run
Over the mountains and down
Into the valley, I will run with You.
#4
Ah, all my fountains are in You.
(Repeat)
