#1
For all that you've done
I will thank you.
For all that you're going to do.
For all that you've promised,
And all that you are
Is all that has carried me through.
Jesus, I thank you.
And I thank you, thank you, Lord.
Thank you, thank you, Lord.
#2
Thank you for loving and setting me free.
Thank you for giving your life just for me.
How I thank you.
Jesus, I thank you, gratefully thank you,
Thank you.
