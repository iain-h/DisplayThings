Give me a pure heart,
Give me a pure heart,
I'm calling to You.
Give me a pure heart,
Give me a pure heart,
I'm longing for You.
#1
If I Seek You, I will find You,
But I need to take the time.
If I call You, You will answer,
But I need to take the time.
#2
If I listen, I will hear You,
But I need to take the time.
If I follow, You will lead me,
But I need to take the time.
