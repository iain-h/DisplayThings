When I am weak, you make me strong.
When I'm poor, I know I'm rich,
For in the power of your name
All things are possible,
All things are possible,
All things are possible,
All things are possible.

Almighty God, my redeemer,
My hiding-place, my safe refuge,
No other name like Jesus,
No pow'r can stand against you.
My feet are planted on this rock
And I will not be shaken.
My hope, it comes from you alone,
My Lord, and my salvation.
#2
Your praise is always on my lips,
Your word is living in my heart
And I will praise you with a new song,
My soul will bless you, Lord.
You fill my life with greater joy,
Yes, I delight myself in you
And I will praise you with a new song,
My soul will bless you, Lord.
