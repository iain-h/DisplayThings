Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Your love makes me sing.
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Your love makes me sing.
#1
Your love is amazing,
Steady and unchanging;
Your love is a mountain,
Firm beneath my feet.
Your love is a mystery,
How You gently lift me;
When I am surrounded,
Your love carries me.
#2
Your love is surprising,
I can feel it rising,
All the joy that's growing
Deep inside of me.
Every time I see You,
All Your goodness shines through,
And I can feel this God song
Rising up in me.

How you make me sing
Lord you make me sing, sing, sing
