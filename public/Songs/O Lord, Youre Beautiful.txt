I wanna take Your word
And shine it all around,
But first help me just to live it, Lord!
And when I'm doing well,
Help me to never seek a crown,
For my reward is giving glory to You.
#1
O Lord, you're beautiful,
Your face is all I seek,
For when Your eyes are on this child,
Your grace abounds to me.
#2
O Lord, please light the fire
That once burned bright and clear,
Replace the lamp of my first love
That burns with holy fear!
