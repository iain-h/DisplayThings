Let it rain, let it rain.
I will not be the same.
Let it rain, rain on me.
Let it pour down on me,
Let it rain, let it rain,
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain on me.
#1
We have prayed that you would have mercy;
We believe from heaven you've heard.
Heal our land, so dry and so thirsty;
We have strayed so far from you, Lord.
Your cloud appeared on the horizon,
Small as a man's hand.
But now you're near, filling our vision,
Pour out your Spirit again.
I felt the touch of your wind on my face:
I feel the first drops of rain.
