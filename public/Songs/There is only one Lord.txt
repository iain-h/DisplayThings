And in the strong name of Jesus,
By the blood of the Lamb,
We are able to triumph,
We are able to stand.
In the power of His Spirit,
By the strength of His hand,
In the strong name of Jesus,
By the precious blood of the Lamb.
#1
There is only one Lord that we cling to,
There is only one truth that we claim;
There is only one way that we walk in,
There is only power in one name.
#2
Though apart from him we can do nothing,
By His Spirit we can do all things;
Covered by His blood we are made righteous,
Lifting up the name of Christ, our King!
