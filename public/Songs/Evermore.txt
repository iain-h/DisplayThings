Evermore my heart, my heart will say
Above all, I live for your glory
Even if my world falls I will say
Above all, I live for your glory
#1
Lost for words with all to say
Lord you take my breath away
Still my soul, my soul cries out, you are holy
And as I look upon your name
Circumstances fade away
Now your glory steals my heart
You are holy
You are holy
You are holy Lord
