Jesus, we celebrate your victory
Jesus, we revel in your love
Jesus, we rejoice you've set us free
Jesus, your death has brought us life

It was for freedom that Christ has set us free
No longer to be subject to a yoke of slavery
So we're rejoicing in God's victory
Our hearts responding to His love
#2
His Spirit in us releases us from fear
The way to him is open, with boldness we draw near
And in His presence our problems disappear
Our hearts responding to His love
