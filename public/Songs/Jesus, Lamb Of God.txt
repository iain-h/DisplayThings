#1
Jesus, Lamb of God,
I stand redeemed,
Washed in Your blood.
And in the holy place I'll bow
To worship and adore.
#2
Jesus, conquering King,
You died for me,
You bore my sins.
Your love has brought me to my knees
To worship and adore,
To worship and adore.
#3
How I love You,
How I love You,
How I love You,
How I love You,
How I love You.
