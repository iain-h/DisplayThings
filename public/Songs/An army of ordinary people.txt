A new day is dawning,
A new age to come,
When the children of promise
Shall flow together as one:
A truth long neglected,
But the time has now come,
When the children of promise
Shall flow together as one.
#1
An army of ordinary people,
A kingdom where love is the key,
A city, a light to the nations,
Heirs to the promise are we.
A people whose life is in Jesus,
A nation together we stand.
Only through grace are we worthy,
Inheritors of the land.
#2
A people without recognition,
But with him a destiny sealed,
Called to a heavenly vision:
His purpose shall be fulfilled.
Come, let us stand strong together,
Abandon ourselves to the King.
His love shall be ours for ever,
This victory song shall we sing.
