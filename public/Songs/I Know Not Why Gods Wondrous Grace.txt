But I know whom I've believèd;
He's able now to save
What I've committed unto Him
Until that final day.
#1
I Know Not Why God's Wondrous Grace
To me hath been made known;
Nor why, unworthy as I am,
He claimed me for His own.
#2
I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart;
Or how believing in His word
Wrought peace within my heart.
#3
I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing men of sin;
Revealing Jesus through the word,
Creating faith in Him.
#4
I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me,
Of weary ways or golden days
Before His face I see.
#5
I know not when my Lord may come;
I know not how or where,
If I shall pass the vale of death,
Or meet Him in the air.
