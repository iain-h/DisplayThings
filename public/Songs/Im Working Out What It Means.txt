I'm Working Out What It Means to follow Jesus,
Adding up what it costs to follow Him;
Counting the times that His love is multiplying,
Realising He took away my sin.
He's always in my memory;
He'll never cancel what He's done for me.
When I add it together I calculate
Jesus is great, Jesus is great!
