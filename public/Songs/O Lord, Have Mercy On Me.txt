#1
O Lord, have mercy on me, and heal me;
O Lord, have mercy on me, and free me.
Place my feet upon a rock,
Put a new song in my heart, in my heart;
O Lord, have mercy on me.
#2
O Lord, may Your love and Your grace protect me;
O Lord, may Your ways and Your truth direct me.
Place my feet upon a rock,
Put a new song in my heart, in my heart;
O Lord, have mercy on me.
