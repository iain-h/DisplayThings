It's rising up, from coast to coast
From north to south and east to west
The cry of hearts that love your name
Which with one voice we will proclaim
#2
The former things have taken place
Can this be the new day of praise?
A heavenly song that comes to birth
And reaches out to all the earth
Oh let the cry to nations ring
That all may come and all may sing
#3
Holy is the Lord (every heart sing)
Holy is the Lord (with one voice sing)
Holy is the Lord (all the earth sing)
Holy is the Lord
#4
And we have heard the lion's roar
That speaks of heaven's love and power
Is this the time, is this the call
That ushers in your kingdom rule?
Oh let the cry of nations ring
That all may come and all may sing
#5
Jesus is alive (every heart sing)
Jesus is alive (with one voice sing)
Jesus is alive (all the earth sing)
Jesus is alive
