All the Heavens shout your praise
Beautiful is our God
The universe will sing
Hallelujah to you our King
#1
Holy, holy are you Lord
The whole earth is filled with your glory
Let the nations rise to give
Honour and praise to your name
#2
Let your face shine on us
And the world will know you live
