I love the God of heaven,
I love His precious Son;
And in the Holy Spirit,
He's making us strong,
And giving us the victory.
I love the God of heaven,
I love His precious Son;
And in the Holy Spirit,
He's making us strong,
And giving us a victory song.
#1
We are marching to a different anthem,
We are dancing to a different song;
And our hearts have come alive with freedom,
Mercy has come, the God of mercy has come.
He is moving through the towns and cities,
He is binding up the broken ones;
And His healing hand is working wonders,
See how they come, He sets them free when they come.
And I sing:
#2
He is training up our hands for battle,
And equipping us to take the land;
For the promises to us are mighty,
We will be strong, and move together as one.
We are heading for our finest hour,
When our Saviour will be magnified,
And His glory will outshine all others:
Jesus is Lord, let Him be praised and adored.
And I sing:
