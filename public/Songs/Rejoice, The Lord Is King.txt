Lift up Your heart, lift up Your voice;
Rejoice! Again I say: rejoice!
#1
Rejoice, the Lord is king!
Your Lord and King adore;
Mortals, give thanks, and sing,
And triumph ever more:
#2
Jesus the Saviour reigns,
The God of truth and love;
When He had purged our stains,
He took His seat above:
#3
His kingdom cannot fail,
He rules o'er earth and heaven;
The keys of death and hell
Are to our Jesus given:
#4
He sits at God's right hand
Till all His foes submit,
And bow to His command,
And fall beneath His feet:
#5
Rejoice in glorious hope;
Jesus the Judge shall come,
And take His servants up
To their eternal home:
#6
We soon shall hear the archangel's voice;
The trump of God shall sound: rejoice!
#A
