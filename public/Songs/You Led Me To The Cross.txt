Jesus, keep me near the cross,
I won't forget the love You've shown.
Saviour, teach me of the cross,
I won't forget the love,
I won't forget the love You've shown.
#1
You Led Me To The Cross,
And I saw Your face of mercy
In that place of love.
You opened up my eyes
To believe Your sweet salvation,
Where I'd been so blind.
Now that I'm living in Your all-forgiving love,
My every road leads to the cross.
#2
And there's an empty tomb,
That tells me of Your resurrection
And my life in You.
The stone lies rolled away,
Nothing but those folded grave clothes
Where Your body lay.
Now that I'm living as a risen child of God,
My every road leads to the cross.
