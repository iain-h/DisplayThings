#1
Like The Sunshine after rainfall,
Like the gentle breeze;
Like the stillness of the morning,
Like the radiant trees:
These things I knew before,
But never have they spoken such life to me;
Oh, the wonder of a Maker
Whose heart delights in me.
#2
Like the nurture of a baby
At its mother's breast;
Like the closeness of a lover,
Like two souls at rest:
These things I knew before,
But never have they spoken such peace to me;
Oh, the wonder of Maker
Whose heart delights in me.
#3
The heavens declare His magnificence,
The earth resounds with His praise;
Be still my soul, and be satisfied
To worship Him,
To worship Him.
#4
Like the vastness of a desert,
Like the ocean's roar;
Like the greatness of the mountains,
Where the eagles soar:
These things I knew before,
But never have they spoken such power to me;
Oh, the wonder of a Maker
Whose heart delights in me.
