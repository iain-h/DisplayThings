You are my Lord,
I'll love you more,
I'll follow you,
No matter when,
No matter where.
#1
I bow my knee,
I give myself
As a living sacrifice for you.
I lay me down
Before your throne.
Take my past; I will stand for you.
Let your blood wash over me,
Let your blood wash over me;
You have cleansed my heart
And set my spirit free.
