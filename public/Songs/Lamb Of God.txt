I exalt You, Jesus my sacrifice;
I exalt You, my Redeemer and my Lord.
I exalt You, worthy Lamb of God,
And in honour I bow down before Your throne.

Lamb of God, Holy one,
Jesus Christ, Son of God,
Lifted up willingly to die,
That I the guilty one may know
The blood once shed, still freely flowing,
Still cleansing, still healing.
