I just want to praise you,
Lift my hands and say, 'I love you.'
You are everything to me
And I exalt your holy name on high.
I just want to praise you,
Lift my hands and say, 'I love you.'
You are everything to me
And I exalt your holy name,
I exalt your holy name,
I exalt your holy name on high.
