I could sing of your love for ever,
I could sing of your love for ever,
I could sing of your love for ever,
I could sing of your love for ever.
#1
Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me,
And I will open up my heart
And let the Healer set me free.
I'm happy to be in the truth,
And I will daily lift my hands,
For I will always sing of
When your love came down.
#2
O, I feel like dancing,
It's foolishness, I know;
But when the world has seen the light,
They will dance with joy
Like we're dancing now.
