#1
Great is the Lord and mighty in power,
His understanding has no limit;
The Lord delights in those who fear Him,
Who put their hope in His unfailing love.
#2
He strengthens the bars of your gates,
He grants you peace in your borders,
He reveals His word to His people;
He has done this for no other nation.
#3
Great is the Lord and mighty in power,
His understanding has no limit;
Extol the Lord, O Jerusalem,
Praise your God, O people of Zion.
