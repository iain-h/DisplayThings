We will break dividing walls,
We will break dividing walls,
We will break dividing walls
In the name of your Son.
We will break dividing walls,
We will break dividing walls
And we will be one.
(Repeat)
#1
There is a place of commanded blessing
Where brethren in unity dwell,
A place where anointing oil is flowing,
Where we live as one.
#2
You have called us to be a body,
You have called us as friends,
Joined together in the bond of the Spirit,
Unto the end.
#3
Father, we join with the prayer of Jesus;
As you are, so let us be one,
Joined together in unity and purpose,
All for the love of your Son.
