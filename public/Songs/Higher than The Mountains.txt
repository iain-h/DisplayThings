#C
Your love never fails, never gives up
Never runs out on me
#1
Higher than the mountains that I face
Stronger than the power of the grave
Constant in the trial and the change
One thing remains
#2
On and on and on and on it goes
It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
And I never, ever, have to be afraid
One thing remains
#3

#B
In death, in life, I'm confident and
covered by the power of your great love
My debt is paid, there's nothing that can
separate my heart from your great love
