Your love is better than life
Your love is better than life
Your love is better than life
O Lord
#1
Lord we love you
We adore you
You alone are worthy of our praise
There's no one higher
In earth or Heaven
Almighty God our thankful voices raise
To you
Alone
You have done all things well
Our God
We give
You glory
#2
Lord we love you
We adore you
All creation stands before your throne
We give you glory
For you are holy
And we sing worthy is our God alone
We give
You praise
The lamb that once was slain
But now
You reign
For ever
