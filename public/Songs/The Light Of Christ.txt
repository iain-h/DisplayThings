The light of Christ
Has come into the world;
The light of Christ
Has come into the world.
#1
All men must be born again
To see the kingdom of God;
The water and the Spirit
Bring new life in God's love.
#2
God gave up His only Son
Out of love for the world,
So that all men who believe in Him
Will live forever.
#3
The light of God has come to us
So that we might have salvation;
From the darkness of our sins we walk
Into glory with Christ Jesus.
