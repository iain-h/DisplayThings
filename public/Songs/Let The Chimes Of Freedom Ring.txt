Let all the people hear the news
Of the One who comes to save:
He's the Lord of all the universe,
And forever He shall reign.
And forever more, yes forever more,
And forever more He will reign.
(Repeat)
#1
Let the chimes of freedom ring
All across this earth;
Lift your voice in praise to Him
And sing of all His worth,
And sing of all His worth.
#2
Open wide your prison doors
To greet the Lord of life;
Songs of triumph fill the air,
Christ Jesus is alive,
Christ Jesus is alive.
#3
In every corner of this earth,
To every tribe and tongue,
Make known that God so loved this world
That He gave His only Son,
He gave His only Son.
#4
Spread the news and make it plain,
He breaks the power of sin;
Jesus died and He rose again,
His love will never end,
His love will never end.
#5
He will return in majesty
To take His rightful place
As the King of all eternity,
The Name above all names,
The Name above all names.
