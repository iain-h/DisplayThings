Not unto us, but unto Your name
Be glory, honour and praise.
Not unto us, but unto Your name
Be glory, honour and praise.
#1
Yours is the greatness and power.
You alone deserve all the fame.
Yours is the splendour and majesty.
From everlasting You're the same.
#2
Yours is the glorious kingdom.
You alone are the King over all.
The earth is under Your dominion now.
You say when nations rise or fall.
