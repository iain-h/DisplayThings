#1
I'm your child and you are my God.
I thank you, Father, for your loving care.
I'm your child and you are my God.
You've made me special and you're
Always there.
#2
I'm your child and you are my God.
I love you, Jesus, you're close to me.
I'm your child and you are my God.
I give you worship, I bow the knee.
#3
I'm your child and you are my God.
Holy Spirit, flow out to me.
I'm your child and you are my God.
You give me power and authority.
