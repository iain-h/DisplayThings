So we sing Your praise, (Jesus is Lord)
We extol Your name, (Jesus is Lord)
Tell the glory of Your kingdom and Your mighty power;
Clothed in majesty, (Jesus is Lord)
Reigning sovereignly, (Jesus is Lord)
Your greatness is unsearchable, O God.
#1
We extol You, our God and King.
We bless Your name
For ever and for ever,
For You open up Your hand
And shower us with goodness.
Your mercy and Your grace
Are freely lavished on us.
