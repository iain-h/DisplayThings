#1
I bow down in humble adoration,
Speak Your name with love and devotion,
Jesus, the Lamb sacrificed for me.
I see Your face, Your tender hands
Scarred for me.
#2
I fall at Your feet with songs of praises singing;
My joy is complete, You fulfil my longing.
Prophet of God, my Priest and my King,
I worship and adore.
#3
Before the Father's throne You ever intercede;
You always hear my prayer, whatever I may plead.
You wipe away my tears, You give me victory;
By Your blood I am cleansed, I am free.
