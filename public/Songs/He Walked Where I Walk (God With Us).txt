#1
He walked where I walk, (echo)
He stood where I stand, (echo)
He felt what I feel, (echo)
He understands. (echo)
He knows my frailty, (echo)
Shared my humanity, (echo)
Tempted in every way, (echo)
Yet without sin. (echo)
God with us, so close to us. (all)
God with us, Immanuel!
(Repeat)
#2
One of a hated race, (echo)
Stung by the prejudice, (echo)
Suffering injustice, (echo)
Yet He forgives. (echo)
Wept for my wasted years, (echo)
Paid for my wickedness, (echo)
He died in my place (echo)
That I might live. (echo)
