The Lord is a warrior,
We will march with him.
The Lord is a warrior,
Leading us to win.
(Repeat)
#1
Our God is awesome in power,
Scatters His enemies;
Our God is mighty in bringing
The powerful to their knees.
He has put on His armour,
He is prepared for war;
Mercy and justice triumph
When the Lion of Judah roars.
#2
Waken the warrior spirit,
Army of God, arise;
Challenge the powers of darkness,
There must be no compromise.
We shall attack their strongholds,
Our hands are trained for war;
We shall advance the kingdom,
For the victory belongs to God.
