He said: ‘freely, freely, You have received,
Freely, freely give;
Go in My name, and because you believe
Others will know that I live.'

God forgave my sin in Jesus' name,
I've been born again in Jesus' name;
And in Jesus' name I come to you
To share His love as He told me to.
#2
All power is given in Jesus' name,
In earth and heaven in Jesus' name;
And in Jesus' name I come to you
To share His power as He told me to.
