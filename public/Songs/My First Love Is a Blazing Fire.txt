And like a child I will dance in Your presence
Oh let the joy of heaven pour down on me
I still remember the first day I met you
And I don't ever want to lose that fire, my first love
#1
My first love is a blazing fire
I feel his powerful love in me
For he has kindled a flame of passion
And I will let it grow in me
And in the night I will sing your praise, my love
And in the morning I'll seek your face my love
#2
My first love is a rushing river
A waterfall that will never cease
And in the torrent of tears and laughter
I feel a healing power released
And I will draw from your well of life, my love
And in your grace I'll be satisfied, my love
#3
Restore the years of the church's slumber
Revive the fire that has grown so dim
Renew the love of those first encounters
That we may come alive again
And we will rise like the dawn throughout the earth
Until the trumpet announces your return.
