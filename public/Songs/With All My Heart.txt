With all my heart,
I will put my trust in you.
With all my heart,
I will put my trust in you.
I will lean on you,
Depend on you,
I will look to the one I love
With all my heart.
#1
When in despair,
And no one else cares,
Storms all around,
No friends can be found;
You're always there,
You're always there for me.
#2
Nothing compares
To your faithfulness,
No greater love
In earth or above:
So I'll declare,
My heart is safe in your arms.
