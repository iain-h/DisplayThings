Unending love,
Your unending love.
#1
Father, I come to You, lifting up my hands
In the name of Jesus, by Your grace I stand.
Just because You love me and I love Your Son,
I know Your favour, unending love.
#2
I receive Your favour, Your unending love,
Not because I've earned it, not for what I've done;
Just because You love me and I love Your Son,
I know Your favour, unending love.
#3
It's the presence of Your kingdom as Your glory fills this place,
And I see how much You love me as I look into Your face.
Nothing could be better, there's nothing I would trade
For Your favour, unending love.
