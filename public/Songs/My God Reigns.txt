My God reigns, his love will never fail me
My God reigns - he's ruling over all
In all my life, in every situation I know
My God is greater, my God is over all
#1
I have a hope so sure, an anchor for my soul
My peace in the worst of times, I trust in God alone
Let every voice declare it now
#2
By faith I have believed
And on this truth I stand
No power in life or death
Can take me from His hand
Let every voice declare it now

My God reigns, his love will never fail me
My God reigns - he's ruling over all
In all my life, in every situation I know
My God is greater, my God is greater
My God is greater, my God is greater
My God is greater, my God is over all

Above all sickness, above all fear
Above every heartache here
In earth and Heav'n - my God reigns!
Above all power, above all thrones
The greatest love I've ever known
Today, forever, my God reigns!
