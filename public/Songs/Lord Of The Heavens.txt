Holy, holy, you are worthy,
Praises to the Son of God.
Jesus, you alone are worthy,
Crowned in righteousness and peace.
Glory, glory, hallelujah,
Praises to the great 'I Am'.
Hosanna, join with angels singing,
Worthy is the Lamb of God.
(Last time)
Worthy is the Lamb of God,
Worthy is the Lamb of God,
Worthy is the Lamb of God.
#1
Lord of the heavens and the earth,
My Saviour, Redeemer, risen Lord,
All honour and glory, pow'r and strength
To him upon the throne.
(Repeat)
