Nothing compares to You,
You're the One we love.
Send down Your holy fire
Over all the earth.
(Repeat)
#1
Only You can replace
Rags for riches pure as gold,
And Your mercy saved my soul,
There's none like You.
#2
At Your name demons flee,
Mountains tremble in Your sight,
But You love me like a friend,
There's none like You.
#3
You have paid such a cost,
So much more than can be won:
God, You gave Your only Son,
There's none like You.
#4
So we'll bow to the cross
Where the tears of heaven fall.
You have heard the sinner's call:
There's none like You.
