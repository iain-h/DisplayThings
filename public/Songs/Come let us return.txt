Come let us return unto the Lord. (men - women echo)
Come let us return unto the Lord. (Men - Women echo)
(Repeat)
#2
For He has torn us,
But He will heal us.
For He has wounded us,
But He will bandage us.
#3
And He will come,
He'll come to us
Like rain, spring rain.
He will come to us
Like rain, spring rain.
