God is here, God is present,
God is moving by His Spirit;
Can you hear what He is saying,
Are you willing to respond?
#2
God is here, God is present,
God is moving by His Spirit;
Lord, I open up my life to You,
Please do just what You will.
#3
Lord, I won't stop loving You,
You mean more to me than anything else.
Lord, I won't stop loving You,
You mean more to me than life itself.
