#C
For yours is the greatness,
The power and the glory;
Lord of the nations,
Have mercy on us.
Though heaven be shaken,
And earth's kingdoms fall,
We will still worship You.
#1
You are worthy to receive
All the honour and praise.
Lamb of God, Prince of Peace,
We lift high Your name.
#2
In the footsteps of our King,
We walk unafraid;
Though the battle may rage,
Our praises will ring.
