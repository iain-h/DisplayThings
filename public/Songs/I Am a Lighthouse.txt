I am a lighthouse, a shining and bright house,
Out in the waves of a stormy sea.
The oil of the Spirit keeps my lamp burning;
Jesus, my Lord, is the light in me.
And when people see the good things that I do,
They'll give praises to God who has sent us Jesus.
We'll send out a lifeboat of love and forgiveness
And give them a hand to get in.

While the storm is raging, whoosh, whoosh,
And the wind is blowing, ooo, ooo,
And the waves are crashing,
Crash! crash! crash! crash!
