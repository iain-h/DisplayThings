#C
You have turned
My mourning into dancing.
You have turned
My sorrow into joy.
#1
Your Light broke through my night,
Restored exceeding joy.
Your grace fell like the rain,
And made this desert live.
#2
Your hand lifted me up,
I stand on higher ground.
Your praise rose in my heart,
And made this valley sing.
#3
This is how we overcome. (x6)
