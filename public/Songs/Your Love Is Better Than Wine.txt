Draw me after You, (x3)
And let us run together.
(Repeat)
Jesus You're the One, (x3)
That I will love forever.
Jesus You're the One, (x3)
That I will love forevermore.
#1
Your Love Is Better Than Wine,
Your name like sweetest perfume;
Oh, that You would kiss me
With the kisses of Your mouth
And draw me, draw me after You.
I hear You whisper my name,
And like a moth to the flame
I fly into the fire of Your intimate love
As You draw me, draw me after You.
#2
So amazing, so divine,
I am Yours and You are mine.
For such love there are no words,
'Cause loving You is heaven on earth.
