Love of My life look deep in My eyes
There you will find what you need
Give Me your life the lust and the lies
The past you're afraid I might see
You've been running away from Me
#2
You're My beloved lover I'm yours
Death shall not part us it's you I died for
For better or worse forever we'll be
My Love it unites us and it binds you to Me
It's a mystery

Love of My life look deep in My eyes
There you will find what you need
I'm the Giver of life I'll clothe you in white
My immaculate bride you will be
Oh, come running home to Me
#4
You're My beloved lover I'm yours
Death shall not part us it's you I died for
For better or worse forever we'll be
My Love it unites us and it binds you to Me
#5
You've been a mistress, My wife
You're chasing lovers that won't satisfy
Won't you let Me make you My bride
You will drink of My lips
And you'll taste new life
#6
You're My beloved lover I'm yours
Death shall not part us it's you I died for
For better or worse forever we'll be
My Love it unites us and it binds you to Me
It's a mystery
