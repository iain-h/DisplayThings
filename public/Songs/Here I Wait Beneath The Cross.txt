Jesus, there's no other name,
Jesus, eternally the same,
Jesus, the King of kings.
Jesus, Redeemer, Saviour, Friend,
Jesus, faithful till the end,
Jesus, the King of kings.
#1
Here I Wait Beneath The Cross,
Resting in the presence of Your love.
Here I wait to know Your heart,
As I worship You in spirit and in truth.
#2
For You are my God,
You are my King,
You reveal deep within to my very soul.
For You alone are
#3
Here I come to give my all,
My hands reach up in holy praise to You.
Here I cast all chains aside
To worship You in spirit and in truth.
