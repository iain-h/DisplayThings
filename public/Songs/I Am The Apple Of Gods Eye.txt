The great fruit of God,
The GREAT FRUIT of God,
The GREAT FRUIT of God it overflows.
(Repeat)
#1
I am the apple of God's eye,
His BANANA over me is love.
He ORANGES His angels to look after me,
As His blessings PLUM-met from above.
#2
Never have to play the GOOSEBERRY,
Feel like a LEMON, no not me.
For wherever this MAN-GOES,
A RASPBERRY it never blows.
#3
I will praise Him on the TANGERINE,
Praise Him on the MANDARIN;
SATSUMA or later you will see
There is always a CLEMENTINE for praising Him.
