#1
Praise You, Lord,
For the wonder of Your healing.
Praise You, Lord,
For Your love so freely given;
Outpouring, anointing,
Flowing in to heal our wounds:
Praise You, Lord, for Your love for me.
#2
Praise You, Lord,
For Your gift of liberation.
Praise You, Lord,
You have set the captives free;
The chains that bind are broken
By the sharpness of Your sword:
Praise You, Lord, You gave Your life for me.
#3
Praise You, Lord,
You have borne the depths of sorrow.
Praise You, Lord,
For Your anguish on the tree;
The nails that tore Your body
And the pain that tore Your soul:
Praise You, Lord, Your tears they fell for me.
#4
Praise You, Lord,
You have turned our thorns to roses.
Glory, Lord,
As they bloom upon Your brow;
The path of pain is hallowed,
For Your love has made it sweet:
Praise You, Lord, and may I love You now.
