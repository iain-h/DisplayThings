Shout to the north and the south,
Sing to the east and the west:
Jesus is Saviour to all,
Lord of heaven and earth.
#1
Men of faith, rise up and sing
Of the great and glorious King;
You are strong when you feel weak,
In your brokenness complete.
#2
Rise up women of the truth,
Stand and sing to broken hearts,
Who can know the healing power
Of our glorious King of love.
#3
We've been through fire,
We've been through rain;
We've been refined
By the power of His name.
We've fallen deeper in love with You,
You've burned the truth on our lips.
Rise up church with broken wings;
Fill this place with songs again,
Of our God who reigns on high:
By His grace again we'll fly.
#4
(Last time)
Lord of heaven and earth,
Lord of heaven and earth,
Lord of heaven and earth.
