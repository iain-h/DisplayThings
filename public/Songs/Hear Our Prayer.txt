Our Father, who art in heaven,
Hallowed be Thy name.
Our Father, hear us from heaven,
Forgive our sins, we pray.
#1
Hear Our Prayer, we are Your children,
And we've gathered here today.
We've gathered here to pray.
Hear our cry, Lord, we need Your mercy
And we need Your grace today,
Hear us as we pray.
#2
Hear our song as it rises to heaven,
May Your glory fill the earth
As the waters cover the sea.
See our hearts and remove anything
That is standing in the way
Of coming to You today.
#3
And though we are few, we're surrounded by many
Who have crossed that river before,
And this is the song we'll be singing forever:
Holy is the Lord, holy is the Lord,
Holy is the Lord, holy is the Lord.
