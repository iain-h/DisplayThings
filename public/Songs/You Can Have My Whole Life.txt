#1
You Can Have My Whole Life,
You can come and have it all:
I don't want to go my own way now,
I love to feel Your presence
And I know Your saving grace.
I am nothing when You are second place.
#2
I've been born to give You praise,
Not to yearn and strive for worldly things.
I've been born to love Your ways,
Take my pride and let me always say:
I want to go Your way now.
