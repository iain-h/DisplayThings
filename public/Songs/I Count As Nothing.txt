You're all that I need,
You're all that I need,
So here I'll stay
And give my praise to You.
#1
I Count As Nothing
every earthly treasure, Jesus;
What You have shown me is that
You are the source of my life.
So what else can I do
But stay here?
#2
Why would I look for
Any worldly pleasure, Jesus,
When I have all things in You?
And just a heartbeat away.
So what else can I do
But stay here with You?
