#1
When the Lord brought us back
And restored our freedom,
We felt so good, we felt so strong,
At first we thought we were dreaming.
How we laughed! How we sang,
We were overflowing;
Then we heard the nations say,
'Look what the Lord has done.'
#2
The Lord has done great things for us,
And we are filled with joy.
The Lord has done great things for us,
And we are filled with joy,
With joy, with joy, with joy.
