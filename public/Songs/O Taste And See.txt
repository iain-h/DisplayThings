O taste and see that the Lord is good,
How blessäd is the man who hides himself in Him.
I sought the Lord and He answered me
And set me free from all my fears.
#2
I will give thanks to Him, for He is good,
His steadfast love to me will never end.
I will give thanks to Him, for He is good,
His steadfast love to me will never end.
