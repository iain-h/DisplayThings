I will seek your face,
Draw me closer to embrace your glory.
I will seek your face,
I run into your secret place
With all my heart and all my strength.
I will seek your face.
#1
I stand before your throne,
The beauty of your holiness amazes me.
From you and you alone
Comes the word of life
And pow'r that changes me.
You are bounteous in mercy,
Abundant in your grace.
You make your face to shine upon me.
#2
In adoration now,
My spirit soars upon the breeze of mercy.
The rapture of my heart
Poured out in songs of love
For you are worthy;
Worth the price of sacrifice,
Surrendering my all,
Changed from glory into glory.
