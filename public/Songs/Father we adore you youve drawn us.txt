All the earth shall worship
At the throne of the King.
Of His great and awesome pow'r
We shall sing!
(Repeat)
#1
Father, we adore you,
You've drawn us to this place.
We bow down before you,
Humbly on our face.
#2
Jesus, we love you,
Because you first loved us,
You reached out and healed us
With your mighty touch.
#3
Spirit, we need you,
To lift us from this mire,
Consumer and empower us
With your holy fire.
#4
Holy is he;
Blessed is he;
Worthy is he;
Gracious is he;
Faithful is he;
Awesome is he;
Saviour is he;
Master is he;
Mighty is he.
Have mercy on me.
