Let the flame burn brighter
In the heart of the darkness,
Turning night to glorious day.
Let the song grow louder
As our love grows stronger,
Let it shine, let it shine.
#1
We'll walk the land
With hearts on fire,
And every step
Will be a prayer.
Hope is rising,
New day dawning,
Sound of singing
Fills the air.
#2
Two thousand years,
And still the flame
Is burning bright
Across the land.
Hearts are waiting,
Longing, aching,
For awakening
Once again.
#3
We'll walk for truth,
Speak out for love;
In Jesus' name
We shall be strong,
To lift the fallen,
To save the children,
To fill the nation
With Your song.
