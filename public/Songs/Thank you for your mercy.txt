Great is your mercy toward me,
Your loving kindness toward me,
Your tender mercies I see
Day after day.
For ever faithful to me,
Always providing for me,
Great is your mercy toward me
Great is your grace.
#1
Thank you for your mercy,
Thank you for your grace;
Thank you for your blood
That's made a way
To come into your presence
And glorify your name.
Lord, I stand amazed at what I see.
#2
Your promises are ageless,
Your love will never end,
For a thousand generations
Your covenant will stand;
Showing grace and mercy
To those who fear your name,
Establishing your righteousness and praise.
