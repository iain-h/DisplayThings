Fill me again, won't You fill me again?
I'm tired and I'm thirsty
And I've come to the end.
Come cleanse me with fire,
Refresh me with rain.
O Breath of the Spirit, come closer.
#1
Lord Of Every Heart,
I'm coming back to You.
I'm standing in the shallows
Of what Your love can do;
Remembering the joy
Of laughter in the rain,
I'm calling from the desert,
Won't You fill me again?
#2
Lord of every deed,
Your promise is enough;
You're unreserved in mercy,
And unrestrained in love.
I'm casting down these crowns
Of all that I can do;
I'm trading my ambitions
For a touch of You.
