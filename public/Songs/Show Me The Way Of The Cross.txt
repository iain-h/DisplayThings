Yes, I resolve to give it all;
Some things must die, some things must live,
Not 'what can I gain', but 'what can I give'.
If much is required when much is received,
Then You can have my whole life,
Jesus, have it all.
#1
Show me the way of the cross once again,
Denying myself for the love that I've gained.
Everything's You now, everything's changed;
It's time You had my whole life,
You can have it all.
#2
I've given like a beggar but lived like the rich,
And crafted myself a more comfortable cross.
Yet what I am called to is deeper than this;
It's time You had my whole life,
You can have it all.
