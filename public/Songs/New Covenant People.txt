To the Father, our creator,
To our Judge and Lord.
And to Jesus, Mediator,
Who has cleansed us in His blood.
#1
New covenant people rejoice,
Lift up your eyes and see your King.
Reigning in power on His heavenly throne,
Angels are joyfully singing:
#2
Let us through Jesus draw near to God,
Offering up our sacrifice,
Confessing that Jesus is Lord over all,
Joining with heavenly praises:
#3
We give thanks to You with fear,
Holy God, consuming fire,
Confessing that Jesus is Lord over all,
We bring our love and devotion:
