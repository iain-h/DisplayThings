Beautiful One
I love You,
Beautiful One
I adore,
Beautiful One my soul must sing.
#1
Wonderful, so wonderful
Is Your unfailing love,
Your cross has spoken mercy over me.
No eye has seen, no ear has heard,
No heart could fully know
How glorious, how beautiful You are.
#2
Powerful, so powerful,
Your glory fills the skies,
Your mighty works displayed for all to see.
The beauty of Your majesty
Awakes my heart to sing:
How marvellous, how wonderful You are.
#3
My soul, my soul must sing,
My soul, my soul must sing,
My soul, my soul must sing,
Beautiful One.

You opened my eyes to Your wonders anew,
You captured my heart with this love
'Cos nothing on earth is as beautiful as You.
