Jesus, Holy One, you are my heart's desire.
King of kings, my everything,
You've set this heart on fire.
(Repeat)
#1
The crucible for silver
And the furnace for gold,
But the Lord tests the heart of this child.
Standing in all purity, God,
Our passion is for holiness,
Lead us to the secret place of praise.
#2
Father, take our offering,
With our song we humbly praise you.
You have brought your holy fire to our lips.
Standing in your beauty, Lord,
Your gift to us is holiness;
Lead us to the place where we can sing:
#A
