Forever God is faithful,

Forever God is with us,
Forever.
Forever.
Forever.
#1
Give thanks to the Lord
Our God and King:
His love endures forever.
For He is good, He is above all things.
His love endures forever.
Sing praise, sing praise
Sing praise, sing praise.
#2
With a mighty hand
And an outstretched arm
His love endures forever.
For the life that's been reborn.
His love endures forever.
Sing praise, sing praise.
Sing praise, sing praise.
#3
From the rising to the setting sun,
His love endures forever.
By the grace of God, we will carry on.
His love endures forever.
Sing praise, sing praise.
Sing praise, sing praise.
