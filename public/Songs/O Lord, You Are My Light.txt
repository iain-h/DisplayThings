O Lord, You are my light,
O Lord, You are my salvation.
You have delivered me from all my fear,
For You are the defence of my life.
#1
For my life is hidden with Christ in God,
You have concealed me in Your love,
You've lifted me up, placed my feet on a rock;
I will shout for joy in the house of God.
