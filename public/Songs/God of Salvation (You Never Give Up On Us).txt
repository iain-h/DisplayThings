You never give up on us
You never let go or turn away
We're holding on to You
Our God is strong, our God is good
#1
You're the God of salvation, we call on Your Name
You came to redeem us, You carry our shame
We stumble and fall down, we turn from Your ways
And then we find mercy, we're held in Your grace
Held in Your grace
#2
You're the God of compassion, friend of the least
Not coming to be served, to serve those in need
We surrender our burdens, our lives at Your cross
And trust in the Saviour, the God who is love
Our God is love
