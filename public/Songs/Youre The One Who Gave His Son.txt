God is still for us, God is still for us,
God is still for us, turn around.
He is still for us, God is still for us,
God is still for us, turn around.
#1
You're The One Who Gave His Son,
Who will freely give us all things,
And nothing can be against us
If God is still for us.
And all things work for good
For those who love the Lord,
And nothing can be against us
When You are still for us.
#2
And we're convinced
That neither death nor life,
Angels or demons,
Height nor depths, nor what's to come
Can cut us off from the love of God.
#3
When hardship or danger comes,
We know that God gave His only Son.
So as a body we are assured
That God is still for us.
We look to You, Lord,
We stand on Your word;
We're holding on
To the promise You've made -
That nothing can be against us
When You are still for us.
