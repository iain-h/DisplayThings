#1
I want to be a tree that's bearing fruit,
That God has pruned and caused to shoot,
O, up in the sky, so very, very high.
I want to be, I want to be a blooming tree.
#2
God has promised His Holy Spirit
Will water our roots and help us grow.
Listen and obey, and before you know it
Your fruit will start to grow, grow, grow, grow, grow.
#3
You'll be a tree that's bearing fruit,
With a very, very, very strong root,
Bright colours like daisies, more fruit than Sainsbury's,
You'll be a blooming tree.
