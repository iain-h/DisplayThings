#1
In these days of refreshing,
In these days of visitation,
There is a reason why You've come.
We have tasted of Your fulness,
One blessing after another,
And that is the reason we say 'come'.
#2
It's not just to make us laugh or cry,
To shake or fall, but to glorify
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
And that is the reason we say 'come'.
#3
And let me know the power to speak
And witness for the gospel,
Let me know the power to pray for the sick
And see them healed.
Let me know the faith that can
Move the mighty mountain,
Let me know the love that joins me
To Your people.
#4
And we say more, Lord,
More of Your power.
We say more, Lord,
More of Your power.
We say more, Lord,
More of Your power,
More of Your power in me.
