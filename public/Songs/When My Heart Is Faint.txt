You are Jesus Christ, faithful One,
Risen King, Champion.
You deserve the highest praise,
The Lamb of God,
Who once was slain for our sin.
#1
When My Heart Is Faint within me,
And my troubles multiply,
I will lift my head to see You
Seated at the Father's side.
You have triumphed over Satan,
You're the firstborn from the grave.
You are always interceding,
You are able now to save.
#2
In my heart I am persuaded
As the Spirit testifies,
And with glory and rejoicing
'Abba, Father' is my cry.
You have raised me up with Jesus
And in Him I am Your son,
So I glory in Your goodness,
In the things that You have done.
