And we rejoice in You,
We put our trust in You,
And with one voice we give You praise.
Singing, let Your kingdom come,
And let Your will be done,
And through Your people
Make Your glory known.
#1
We Look To You, Almighty God,
You are high and lifted up,
You are sovereign over all
That You have made.
Over kingdoms and their kings,
You are Lord of everything,
Over things on earth
And things that are unseen.
#2
Lord, we come to seek Your face,
Let Your glory fill this place,
We are hungry for Your
Presence in this hour.
To behold You as You are,
Heaven's bright and morning Star,
Let our hearts be changed,
And let Your kingdom come!
