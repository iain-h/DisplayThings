I'm like a child in His eyes,
And He will meet my needs
With all the riches of heaven;
And He loves me much too much
To let me go,
He will keep me in His love.
#1
I was lost without a trace,
All except for the eyes of heaven.
Now my Saviour's love has found me,
And His love has brought me home.
#2
I can sleep in peace tonight,
I won't worry about tomorrow,
Now I know my Daddy loves me,
And His perfect love will conquer all.
#3
Heaven and earth may pass away,
And mountains fall into the ocean;
But His word is everlasting,
And His love goes on and on.
