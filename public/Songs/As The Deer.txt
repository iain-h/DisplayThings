#C
You alone are my strength, my shield,
To You alone may my spirit yield.
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship You.
#1
As the deer pants for the water,
So my soul longs after You.
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship You.
#2
I want You more than gold or silver,
Only You can satisfy.
You alone are the real joy-giver
And the apple of my eye.
#3
You're my Friend and You are my Brother,
Even though You are a King.
I love You more than any other,
So much more than anything.
