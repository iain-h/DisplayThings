God, be gracious and bless us
And make your face shine on us:
Let your ways be known,
Your salvation shown
All over the earth;
Let your ways be known,
Your salvation shown
All over the earth.

May the peoples praise you, O God,
May all the peoples praise you;
May the nations be glad and sing for joy,
For you come to rule them justly.
May the peoples praise you, O God,
For you guide the nations of the earth;
May the peoples praise you, O God,
The nations be glad and sing for joy.
