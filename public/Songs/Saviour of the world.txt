For He made us a way
by which we have been saved
He's the Saviour of the world
So we lift up a shout for His fame and renown
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
Jesus, Saviour of the world
#1
God so loved, that He gave His son
To lay down His life for the sake of us
He bore the weight of our sin and shame
With a cry He said, It is finished
#2
We must spread the word of His soon return
To reclaim the world for His glory
Let the church now sing of this coming King
Crowned with majesty, our Redeemer

Christ the Lord overcame the darkness
He's alive: death has been defeated
#6
And He reigns, ruler of the heavens
And His name is Jesus, the Messiah
