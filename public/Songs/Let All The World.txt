Let all the world in every corner sing:
‘My God and King!'
The heavens are not too high;
His praise may thither fly:
The earth is not too low;
His praises there may grow.
Let all the world in every corner sing:
‘My God and King!'

Let all the world in every corner sing:
‘My God and King!'
The Church with psalms must shout,
No door can keep them out:
But, above all, the heart
Must bear the longest part.
Let all the world in every corner sing:
‘My God and King!'
