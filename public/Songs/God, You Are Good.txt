I'm happy to be a friend of God.
I'm happy that God's a friend to me.
#1
God, You Are Good, God, You are kind.
God, You are sun, God, You are shine.
God, You are truth, God, You are pure.
You've melted my heart,
And now I am Yours.
#2
You're bursting with love
For the ones that You made.
You're happy to bless
Every one of their days.
You humble the proud
But You raise up the low.
You cry for the lost
But You eat with the poor.
#3
And You love me so much
That You weep for my pain,
And You guide with Your touch.
For it is not Your heart to see me fall,
Or let my sin remain.
