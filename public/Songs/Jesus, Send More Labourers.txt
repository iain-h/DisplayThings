Oh Lord, but start with me,
Jesus, begin with me.
Who will go for You, Lord?
Who will go for You, Lord?
Here I am, Lord,
Send me,
Send me, Lord,
Send me.
#1
Jesus, send more labourers,
For, Lord, we see the need;
The land is ready for harvest,
The fields are ripe indeed.
#2
Lord, we love our country,
Countless lives to be won;
Jesus, bring revival,
That through us Your will be done.
#3
Lord, we sense Your moving,
Touching our lives with power;
We are ready to serve You,
To go this day, this hour.
