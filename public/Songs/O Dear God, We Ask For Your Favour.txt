And I will climb this mountain,
And I step off the shore;
And I have chosen to follow,
And be by Your side forevermore.

O Dear God, We Ask For Your Favour,
Come and sweep through this place.
Oh, we desire You.
I just want to be with You, be where You are,
Dwell in Your presence, O God.
Oh, I want to walk with You.
#2
Tell me what You want me to do, Lord God,
Tell me what You want for my life.
It's Yours, O God, it's Yours.
Do Your will, have Your way,
Be Lord God in this place.
Oh, I want Your will to be done.
