#1
O my Saviour, lifted
From the earth for me,
Draw me, in Thy mercy,
Nearer unto Thee.
#2
Lift my earthbound longings,
Fix them, Lord, above;
Draw me with the magnet
Of Thy mighty love.
#3
And I come, Lord Jesus;
Dare I turn away?
No! Thy love hath conquered,
And I come today.
#4
Bringing all my burdens,
Sorrow, sin, and care;
At Thy feet I lay them,
And I leave them there.
