This I know, my God is for me,
This I know.
This I know, my God is on my side;
My God is for me, this I know.
#1
If God did not spare His only Son,
But delivered Him up for us all,
Will He not give us every good thing
When we come in His name and call?
#2
Let us draw near the throne of grace
For mercy and help in our need;
For Jesus is ever praying for us,
He is living to intercede.
