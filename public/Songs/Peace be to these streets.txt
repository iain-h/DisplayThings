Walk here, Lord,
Draw near, Lord,
Pass through these streets today.
Bring healing, forgiveness;
Here let your living waters flow.

Peace be to these streets,

Peace be to these streets
In the name of Jesus.

Peace be to these streets,
Peace be to these streets,
Peace be to these streets
In the name of Jesus.

Love come to these streets,
Love come to these streets,
Love come to these streets
In the name of Jesus.

Joy come to these streets,
Joy come to these streets,
Joy come to these streets
In the name of Jesus.
