And all that I have
I lay at the feet
Of the wonderful Saviour
Who loves me.
#1
Wonderful Grace,
That gives what I don't deserve,
Pays me what Christ has earned,
Then lets me go free.
Wonderful grace,
That gives me the time to change,
Washes away the stains
That once covered me.
#2
Wonderful love,
That held in the face of death,
Breathed in its latest breath
Forgiveness for me.
Wonderful love,
Whose power can break every chain,
Giving us life again,
Setting us free.
