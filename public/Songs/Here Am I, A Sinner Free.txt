Lost and dirty, yet You found me.
Stained by sin, but You have cleansed me.
Can it be I'm precious in Your sight?
What is man, and who am I?
A child of God, my Father's pride,
What a joy to be the Lord's delight.
#1
Here Am I, A Sinner Free,
Pardoned by Your majesty,
Your love has led me into liberty.
Holy King, upon the throne,
You've made this heart Your very own.
I feel like the leper who's been healed.
#2
I have known a love so sweet,
A saving love that brings relief,
A healing love that makes the blind eye see.
King of Love and Prince of Peace,
Your Shepherd's love is tending me -
A love that satisfies my deepest needs.
