O my God, I trust in Thee,
Let me not be ashamed,
Let not mine enemies triumph over me.
#1
Unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul,
Unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
#2
Yea, let none that wait on Thee be ashamed,
Yea, let none that wait on Thee be ashamed.
#3
Show me Thy ways, Thy ways, O Lord,
Teach me Thy paths, Thy paths, O Lord.
#4
Remember not the sins of my youth,
Remember not the sins of my youth.
#5
The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him,
The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him.
#6
Unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul,
Unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
