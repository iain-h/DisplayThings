You're faithful, faithful, and Your mercy never ends;
The world will pass away, but Your words are here to stay.
You're wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God.
Lord Jehovah, You are the great I AM.

Lord, you're faithful and just,
In You I put my trust, mighty God,
Everlasting Father.
Your word is faithful and true,
What You promised You will do, oh Lord.
Your word endures for ever.
