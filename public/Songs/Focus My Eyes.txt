#1
Focus my eyes on You, O Lord,
Focus my eyes on You;
To worship in spirit and in truth,
Focus my eyes on You.
#2
Turn round my life to You, O Lord,
Turn round my life to You;
To know from this night You've made me new,
Turn round my life to You.
#3
Fill up my heart with praise, O Lord,
Fill up my heart with praise;
To speak of Your love in every place,
Fill up my heart with praise.
