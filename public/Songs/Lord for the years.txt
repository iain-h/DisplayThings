#1
Lord, for the years
Your love has kept and guided,
Urged and inspired us,
Cheered us on our way,
Sought us and saved us,
Pardoned and provided,
Lord of the years,
We bring our thanks today.
#2
Lord, for that Word,
The Word of life which fires us,
Speaks to our hearts
And sets our souls ablaze,
Teaches and trains,
Rebukes us and inspires us:
Lord of the Word,
Receive your people's praise.
#3
Lord, for our land,
In this our generation,
Spirits oppressed by pleasure,
Wealth and care;
For young and old,
For commonwealth and nation,
Lord of our land,
Be pleased to hear our prayer.
#4
Lord, for our world;
When we disown and doubt him,
Loveless in strength,
And comfortless in pain,
Hungry and helpless,
Lost indeed without him:
Lord of the world,
We pray that Christ may reign.
#5
Lord for ourselves;
In living pow'r remake us û
Self on the cross
And Christ upon the throne,
Past put behind us,
For the future take us:
Lord of our lives,
To live for Christ alone.
