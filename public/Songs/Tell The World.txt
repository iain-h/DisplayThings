Tell The World that Jesus is risen,
Let His praise encircle the globe;
Make it known among all the nations
That Jesus is alive!
#1
From the cradle to the grave,
From a stable to a cross,
His life was offered up in sacrifice for us.
He came from heaven's throne
To seek and save the lost;
To reconcile us back to God.
#2
No eye has seen, no ear has heard what He's prepared;
His resurrection means His life is ours to share.
The greatest miracle of all has taken place;
Christ is risen, He is Lord!
