I was made to praise You,
I was made to glorify Your name,
In every circumstance
To find a chance to thank You.
I was made to love You
I was made to worship at Your feet,
And to obey You, Lord.
I was made for You.
#2
I will always praise You,
I will always glorify Your name.
In every circumstance
I'll find a chance to thank You.
I will always love You,
I will always worship at Your feet,
And I'll obey You, Lord.
I was made for You.
