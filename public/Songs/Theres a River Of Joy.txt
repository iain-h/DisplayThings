There's a river of joy
That flows from your throne,
O river of joy, flow through me.
There's a river of joy
That flows from your throne,
Come, Holy Spirit, with joy,
Come, Holy Spirit, with joy.
(Repeat)
#1
I will rise up on the wings of an eagle;
With joy I receive your love.
I will praise you with a song everlasting.
Thank you, Lord, for your love,
Thank you, Lord, for your love.
