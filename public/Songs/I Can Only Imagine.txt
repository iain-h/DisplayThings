Surrounded by your glory, what will my heart feel?
Will I dance for you Jesus?
Or in awe of you be still?
Will I stand in your presence?
Or to my knees will I fall?
Will I sing Hallelujah?
Will I be able to speak at all?
I can only imagine
#1
I can only imagine
What it will be like
When I walk by your side
I can only imagine
What my eyes will see
When your face is before me
I can only imagine
I can only imagine
#2
I can only imagine
When that day comes
And I find myself
Standing in the Son
I can only imagine
When all I would do
Is forever,
Forever worship you
I can only imagine
I can only imagine
