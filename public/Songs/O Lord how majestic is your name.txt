O Lord, how majestic is your name,
O Lord, how majestic is your name,
You are high and lifted up
And your glory fills the temple,
You are high and lifted up
And we worship you.
You are high and lifted up
And your glory fills the temple.
We worship you in spirit and truth,
We worship you in spirit and truth.
(Repeat)
#2
You are exalted on high,
You reign in wisdom,
In power and in might.
