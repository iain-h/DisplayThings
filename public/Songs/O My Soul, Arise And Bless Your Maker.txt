And I will sing for all my days
Of heaven's love come down.
Each breath I take will speak His praise
Until He calls me home.
#1
O My Soul, Arise And Bless Your Maker,
For He is your Master and your Friend.
Slow to wrath but rich and tender mercy:
Worship the Saviour, Jesus.
#2
King of grace, His love is overwhelming;
Bread of Life, He's all I'll ever need,
For His blood has purchased me forever:
Bought at the cross of Jesus.
#3
When I wake, I know that He is with me;
When I'm weak, I know that He is strong.
Though I fall, His arm is there to lean on:
Safe on the Rock of Jesus.
#4
Stir in me the songs that You are singing;
Fill my gaze with things as yet unseen.
Give me faith to move in works of power,
Making me more like Jesus.
#5
Then one day I'll see Him as He sees me,
Face to face, the Lover and the loved;
No more words, the longing will be over:
There with my precious Jesus.
