Work a miracle in my heart,
Work a miracle in my heart,
Work a miracle in my heart,
O Lord, today.
#1
We Are Called To Be Prophets To This Nation,
To be the word of God in every situation;
Change my heart, change my heart today.
Who'll be the salt if the salt should lose its flavour?
Who'll be the salt if the salt should lose its flavour?
Change my heart, change my heart today.
#2
Lord, loose the chains of oppression;
Lord, set the captives free.
Lord, fill my heart with compassion:
Shine Your light, shine Your light,
Shine Your light through me.
#3
Lord, take all of my lies and take all of my greed;
Let me be a sacrifice for those who are in need.
Change my heart, change my heart today.
Lord, without Your power it's all just good intentions;
Lord, without Your grace who could find redemption?
Change my heart, change my heart today.
