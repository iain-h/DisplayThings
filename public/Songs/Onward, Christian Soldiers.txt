Onward, christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.

Onward, christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before!
Christ, the royal Master,
Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle,
See, His banners go!
#2
At the name of Jesus
Satan's host doth flee;
On then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory!
Hell's foundations quiver
At the shout of praise;
Brothers, lift your voices;
Loud your anthems raise:
#3
Like a mighty army
Moves the church of God:
Brothers we are treading
Where the saints have trod.
We are not divided,
All one body we,
One in hope and doctrine,
One in charity.
#4
Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the church of Jesus
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never
'Gainst that church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise,
And that cannot fail:
#5
Onward, then, ye people!
Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph-song:
Glory, laud, and honour
Unto Christ the King!
This through countless ages
Men and angels sing:
