We are a chosen people, a royal priesthood,
A holy nation, belonging to God.
We are a chosen people, a royal priesthood,
A holy nation, belonging to God.
#1
You have called us out of darkness
To declare Your praise.
We exalt You and enthrone You,
Glorify Your name.
#2
You have placed us into Zion
In the new Jerusalem.
Thousand thousand are their voices,
Singing to the Lamb.
