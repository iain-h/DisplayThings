His name is Jesus
Friend of Sinners
Jesus, Jesus
Friend of mine

There is a voice that must be heard
There is a song that must be sung
There is name that must be lifted high
There is a treasure more than gold
There is a King upon the throne
There is One whose praise will fill the skies
#2
There is a peace that calms our fears
There is a love stronger than death
There is a hope that goes beyond the grave
There is a friend that won't let go
There is a heart that beats for you
There is one name by which we are saved

When I was captive to my fears
You were the one who came to me
You set me free
You set me free
You set me free
You set me free
