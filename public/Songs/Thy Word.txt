Thy word is a lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path.
(Repeat)
#1
When I feel afraid,
Think I've lost my way,
Still You're there right beside me.
And nothing will I fear
As long as You are near;
Please be near me to the end.
#2
I will not forget
Your love for me, and yet
My heart forever is wandering.
Jesus, be my guide
And hold me to Your side,
And I will love You to the end.
