The shout of the king is among us
God lives here in our praises
The shout of the king is among us
Praise him praise him
Praise him in everything
#1
I give you praise for you deserve it
I give you praise for what you've done
I give you praise for you are able
I give you praise 'til I overcome
#2
I give you praise when the sun is shining
I give you praise in the dark of night
I give you praise when the battle rages
I give you praise 'til it works out right
#B
Heaven opens as we sing your praise
Angels join us as we praise your name
