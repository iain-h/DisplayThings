What a wonderful Maker,
What a wonderful Saviour.
How majestic Your whispers,
And how humble Your love.
With a strength like no other,
And the heart of a Father,
How majestic Your whispers,
What a wonderful God.
#1
You Spread Out The Skies
Over empty space,
Said 'Let there be light' -
To a dark and formless world
Your light was born.
#2
You spread out Your arms
Over empty hearts,
Said 'Let there be light' -
To a dark and hopeless world
Your Son was born.
#3
You made the world and saw that it was good,
You sent Your only Son, for You are good.
#4
No eye has fully seen
How beautiful the cross,
And we have only heard
The faintest whisper of
How great You are.
