He will be called Wonderful,
Counsellor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
(Repeat)
The Prince of Peace.
#1
The People Who Walk In Darkness
Will see a great light,
For those who live in the land
Of the shadow of death,
The light will shine.
#2
You will enlarge the nation,
And increase their joy,
So they delight in Your presence
As they will rejoice
At harvest time.
#3
For to us a Child is born,
To us a Son is given,
And the government
Will be upon His shoulders.
Of His government and peace
There will always be increase;
There is no end to His kingdom.
#4
For to us a Child is born,
To us a Son is given,
And the government
Will be upon Your shoulders.
Come to break our yoke of grief,
The bar across our shoulders;
Lord, smash the rod of our oppressors.
