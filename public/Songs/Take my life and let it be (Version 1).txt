#1
Take my life, and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to thee;
Take my moments and my days,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.
#2
Take my hands, and let them move
At the impulse of thy love;
Take my feet, and let them be
Swift and beautiful for thee.
#3
Take my voice, and let me sing
Always, only, for my King;
Take my lips, and let them be
Filled with messages from thee.
#4
Take my silver and my gold;
Not a mite would I withhold;
Take my intellect, and use
Every pow'r as thou shalt choose.
#5
Take my will, and make it thine:
It shall be no longer mine;
Take my heart: it is thine own;
It shall be thy royal throne.
#6
Take my love; my Lord, I pour
At thy feet its treasure-store;
Take myself, and I will be
Ever, only, all for thee.
#A
