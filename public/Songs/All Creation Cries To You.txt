God is great and His praise
Fills the earth, fills the heavens,
And Your name will be praised
Through all the world.
God is great, sing His praise
All the earth, all the heavens,
'Cause we're living for the glory of Your name,
The glory of Your name.
#1
All creation cries to you,
Worshipping in spirit and in truth.
Glory to the Faithful One,
Jesus Christ, God's Son.
#2
All creation gives You praise,
You alone are truly great;
You alone are God who reigns
For eternity..
#3
All to You, O God, we bring.
Jesus, teach us how to live.
Let Your fire burn in us
That all may hear and all may see.

All to You, O God, we bring.

"Holy is the Lord,"
The whole earth sings,
The whole earth sings.
