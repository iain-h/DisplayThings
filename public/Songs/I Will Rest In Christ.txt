I will rest in Christ;
I will hope in Him.
I will find a place of comfort,
I can find a place of rest,
Held in love, loved in Him,
Safe, I am secure,
As I rest in Christ,
As I hope in Him.
#1
I will rest in Christ
Like the calm within the storm;
I can find security in Him who leads me on.
I will put my faith, my trust and every hope,
For the peace of God will touch my soul,
In Him I will be whole.
I am not dismayed, I am not cast down;
I will never be alone, I need never fear.
I can always hope, I can always love;
For the love of God has touched my heart,
In Him I am secure.
#2
I will trust in Christ
Like a rock in stormy seas;
I have found a shelter in His life and peace in me.
I have found the way,
The truth, this perfect life;
And the hope in me is found in Him,
The lover of my soul.
