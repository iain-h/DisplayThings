And you lived and you died
And you rose again on high
And you opened the way for the world to live again
Hallelujah for all you've done
#1
My saviour, redeemer
Lifted me from the miry clay
Almighty, forever
I will never be the same

'Cause you came near
From the everlasting
To the world we live
The Father's only son
