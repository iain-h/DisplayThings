Rise up, my soul, and sing.
Rise up, my soul, and sing.
Rise up, my soul, and give glory to the Lord.
(Repeat)
#1
Awake, my soul, rise up from your sleeping;
Do not slumber or sleep any more.
Raise your weary head to a new day;
Lift your shout, let your voice be heard.
#2
Rocks will cry out if we are silent,
Trees will clap their hands and rejoice;
The mighty ocean roars with a new song,
Mountains bow down to honour Your name.
#3
Let the song of a bride in blooming
Thunder clap through the heavens above.
Rising up in true adoration,
Arise and shine for Your light has come.
#4
I don't want to sleep any more,
But I'll awake the dawn with singing.
Hear this crying heart of mine,
As I lift up my song.
(Repeat)
#5
Lift it up, lift it up, lift it up.
