Jesus, let Your name
Be fragrant in me,
Like perfume that's poured
From this vessel of clay.
(Repeat)
#1
I Have Come To Realise
The glory of the Lord resides
In this jar of clay.
And if my world is going to see
The glory of the Lord revealed,
Then my pride must break.
Then the fragrance of Jesus
Will be released,
And the glory of God will be revealed
In all my world.
#2
And I will live all my days
To be the praise,
And I will live all my days
To be the praise of Your glory.
