Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty,
And we rejoice in You alone,
For You are worthy.
And You have given life to me,
And I love to worship at Your feet,
And I love to love You just for who You are.
#1
Good And Gracious,
Attributes of a loving Father,
You're high and mighty,
But humble all the same.
You have made the heavens and the earth,
And You made us in Your image, Lord.
#2
Death and hell are
Now no longer things I fear because
You have saved me
And I'm grateful to the core.
I'm Your child because of Jesus' blood,
And Your Spirit leads me,
Guides me, fills me.
#3
I'm so grateful for the things
You have given me:
Your love, Your grace, Your joy,
Your peace and more.
Holy, holy.
Holy, holy.
