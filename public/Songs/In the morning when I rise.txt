#1
In the morning when I rise
Expectantly I lift my eyes
And I see you (and I see you).
Gazing on your heav'nly throne,
In your presence I'm at home,
Here with you (here with you).
And all I want
Is more and more of you.
#2
Earthly cares and passions pale
When you take away the veil
And I see you (and I see you).
When you open heaven's door
All I want is to have more,
More of you (more of you).
And all I want
Is more and more of you.
#3
The earth and all its glory will fade,
But the word of our God will stand.
The earth and all its glory will fade,
But the kingdom of God I will seek.
#4
Nothing in the world compares
To the love that I can share
Alone with you (alone with you).
There is nothing else so real
As the things that you reveal
When I'm with you (when I'm with you).
And all I want
Is more and more of you.
