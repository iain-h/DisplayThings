I will praise the mighty name of Jesus,
Praise the Lord, the lifter of my head.
Praise the Rock of my salvation,
All my days are in His faithful hands.

My Troubled Soul, why so weighed down?
You were not made to bear this heavy load.
Cast all Your burdens upon the Lord;
Jesus cares, He cares for you.
#2
Jesus cares, He cares for you.
And all your worrying
Won't help you make it through.
Cast all your burdens upon the Lord.
And trust again in the promise of His love.
#3
My anxious heart, why so upset?
When trials come, how you so easily forget
To cast your burdens upon the Lord;
Jesus cares, He cares for you.
