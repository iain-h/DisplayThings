And I surrender all,
And I surrender all;
Unveil my heart to see
The wonder of Your worth,
As I surrender all,
As I surrender all.
#1
When Words Are Not Enough
To tell of all You've done,
I bow the knee, let silence speak,
And gaze upon Your majesty.
#2
These songs could not convey
A picture of Your love;
And knowing this, my life I give
To You, an offering of praise.
#3
The worship You require
Is brokenness of heart;
So here I stand with open hands,
Surrendered to Your love and power.
