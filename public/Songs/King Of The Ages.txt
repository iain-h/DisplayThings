King Of The Ages, Almighty God,
Perfect love, ever just and true.
Who will not fear You and bring You praise?
All the nations will come to You.
#1
Your ways of love have won my heart,
And brought me joy unending.
Your saving power at work in me,
Bringing peace and the hope of glory.
#2
Your arms of love are reaching out
To every soul that seeks You;
Your light will shine in all the earth,
Bringing grace and a great salvation.
#3
The day will come when You appear,
And every eye shall see You.
Then we shall rise with hearts ablaze,
With a song we will sing forever.
