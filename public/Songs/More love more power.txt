More love (more love),
More power (more power),
More of you in my life.
(Repeat)
#1
And I will worship you with all of my heart,
And I will worship you with all of my mind,
And I will worship you with all of my strength,
For you are my Lord.
#2
And I will seek your face with all of my heart,
And I will seek your face with all of my mind,
And I will seek your face with all of my strength,
For you are my Lord.
#3
For you are my Lord; you are my Lord.
