And I'll remember You,
I will turn back and do
The things I used to do
For the love of You.
Lord, I'll remember You,
I will turn back and do
The things I need to do
For the love You.

When My Heart Runs Dry
And there's no song to sing,
No holy melody,
No words of love within,
I recall the height from which
This fragile heart has slipped.
#2
You are my soul's desire,
You are the hope within,
You bring my heart to life,
You make my spirit sing.
I recall the height from which
This fragile heart has slipped.
