And from Your fulness we have all received
Grace upon grace,
Kindness on kindness.
And from Your fulness we have all received
Grace upon grace,
Like wave upon wave
From the ocean of Your love.
#1
Lord, You stand willing
And ready to bless,
You bid us bring You
Great requests;
Though many are saying
'Who will show us good?'
Day after day we see Your mercies.
#2
Lord, You're the Author
Of every good gift;
You give us all
We need to live.
Lord, You became poor
To make us rich,
You crown our lives with Your compassion.
