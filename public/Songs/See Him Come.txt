See him come, the King upon a donkey.
Where is all His majesty and power?
He who was glorious, yet for my sake
Put away glory to die upon the cross.
His body was broken,
His heart was torn apart for me upon the cross.

See the people line His path with palm leaves;
Hear the children shouting out His name.
He who was glorious, yet for my sake
Put away power to die upon the cross.
His body was broken,
His heart was torn apart for me upon the cross.
