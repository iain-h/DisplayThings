Hail to the king,
Hail to the King,
Hail to the King of kings.
(Repeat)
#1
Abraham's Son, chosen one,
Zion's cornerstone;
Passover Lamb, Son of Man,
Seated upon Your throne.
#2
O promised Seed, beneath Your feet
Sin and death shall fall.
Now through us tread the serpent's head
Till You are all in all.
#3
The world's yet to see Your glory,
But You'll be revealed in power,
And You will reign with the Bride ordained
For Your consummating hour.
