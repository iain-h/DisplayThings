You are a mighty warrior
Clothed in armour of light
Crushing the deeds of darkness
Lead us on in the light
In the name of Jesus
Victorious we stand
We place you in the highest place
Above all else in this land
#1
You are exalted Lord above all else
We place you on the highest place
Above all else
Right here where we stand
And everywhere we go
We place you on the highest place
So the world will know
