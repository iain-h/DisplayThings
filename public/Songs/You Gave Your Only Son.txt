Praise You, Jesus, I praise You,
I lift my hands and sing.
Embrace You, I will embrace You,
My Saviour and my King, my King.
#1
You Gave Your Only Son,
Came down from heaven above,
Endured the cross, so I might know
This love that reached for me,
A love that sets me free,
Your sacrifice has saved my soul.
#2
Today I'm reminded of Your grace;
Always living now to sing Your praise,
Your praise.
#3
I could not earn this love,
Such undeserved love;
Jesus, I know You are the way.
You paid the price for me,
Your blood was shed for me,
And in Your mercy took my place.
