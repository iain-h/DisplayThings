I gaze on the One who so desired
Friendship with one as low as me.
You left behind Your throne
So I'll sing of Your love (sing of Your love).
#1
One Thing I Ask, one thing I seek,
To see Your face, to gaze upon Your beauty,
To search behind the eyes of love.
#2
To spend my days within the veil,
Where the purity and light pour over me,
And I am changed.
#3
All I held close I now let go.
All else is loss compared to knowing You,
And I am changed.
