Take my whole heart;
I won't hold back the least part.
I wanna fall face forward
Into the arms of grace.
Oh, may my passion become so undivided
That I won't be satisfied with nothing less,
Nothing less than You.
#1
Hear My Confession in Your compassion;
Could You lead me in the way that I should go?
If I lose my life for You, I know I'll find it;
Could Your will become incarnate in my soul?
#2
For I would rather learn to open doors in Your house,
Than spend the rest of my days wasted somewhere else.
For I could never be free or feel Your peace
Till I surrender to Your love.
#3
Could You give me a hunger for Your kingdom,
That my own desires would all take second place?
