This is our heart cry;
This is our heart cry.
This is our heart cry;
This is our heart cry.
#1
We're standing here with open hearts,
Our voices joined in unity.
We know we don't lead perfect lives,
And we cry to You for mercy.
Father in heaven, we honour Your name,
That we might bring You glory and fame;
Pour out Your Spirit upon us we pray,
To heal and deliver and save.
#2
We stand before the throne of grace,
A people for Your possession;
We hunger and thirst, we seek Your face,
Come touch us with Your presence.
Father in heaven, holy and true,
Stretch out Your hand, let power break through;
Pour out Your Spirit upon us today,
To heal and deliver and save.
