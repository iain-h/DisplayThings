And we will crown You Lord of all
Yes, we will crown you Lord of all
For you have won the victory
Yes, we will crown you Lord of all
#1
Father in heaven, our voices we raise
Receive our devotion, receive now our praise
As we sing of the glory of all that you've done
The greatest love story that's ever been sung
#2
Father in Heaven, Our lives are your own
We've been caught by a vision of Jesus alone
Who came as a servant to free us from sin
Father in Heaven our worship we bring
#3
We will sing "Hallelujah" we will sing to the King
To our mighty deliverer our hallelujahs will ring
Yes our praise is resounding to the Lamb on the throne
He alone is exalted through the love he has shown
