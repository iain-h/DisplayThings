How marvellous! how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
How marvellous! How wonderful!
Is my Saviour's love for me!
#1
I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner, condemned, unclean.
#2
For me it was in the garden He prayed,
Not My will, but Thine':
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat drops of blood for mine.
#3
In pity angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.
#4
He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden of Calvary,
And suffered and died alone.
#5
When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me.
