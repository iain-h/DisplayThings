Your voice, it is like thunder
Over the waters.
Your voice echoes throughout the earth,
We will bow to the sound,
We will bow to the sound
Of Your voice.
#1
O Lord, arise, release Your power,
Scatter Your foes this very hour.
May we hold on to Your holy commands.
You are the Lord of every man.
#2
You hold our lives, You give us breath,
You freed us from the power of death.
You're our salvation, our only hope,
You are the Lord of every man.
