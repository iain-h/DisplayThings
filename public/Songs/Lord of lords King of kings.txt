Glory to God Almighty in the highest!

Lord of lords, King of kings,
Maker of heaven and earth
And all good things.
We give you glory.
Lord Jehovah, Son of Man,
Precious Prince of Peace and the great 'I Am'.
We give you glory.
#2
Lord, you're righteous in all your ways.
We bless your holy name
And we will give you praise.
We give you glory.
You reign for ever in majesty.
We praise you and lift you up for eternity.
We give you glory.
