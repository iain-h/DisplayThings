I'm fixed on you, I'll honour you
I look to you, you're everything to me
I'm fixed on you, I'll honour you I look to you
You're everything to me
Live fixed

You came and rescued me
Took my heart and made me whole
You let me see I can live for you
#2
You came and you called me
Gave me faith and gave me strength 
Now I can see I can live for you

So I choose right now that I will live for you
And I choose right now that I will trust in you
