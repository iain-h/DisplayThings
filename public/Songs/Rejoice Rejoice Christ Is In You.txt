Rejoice! rejoice!
Christ is in you,
The hope of glory
In our hearts.
He lives! He lives!
His breath is in you,
Arise a mighty army,
We arise.
#1
Now is the time for us
To march upon the land,
Into our hands
He will give the ground we claim.
He rides in majesty
To lead us into victory,
The world shall see
That Christ is Lord!
#2
God is at work in us
His purpose to perform,
Building a kingdom
Of power not of words,
Where things impossible,
By faith shall be made possible;
Let's give the glory
To Him now.
#3
Though we are weak, His grace
Is everything we need;
We're made of clay
But this treasure is within.
He turns our weaknesses
Into His opportunities,
So that the glory
Goes to Him.
