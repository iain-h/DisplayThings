Holy One of God,
The Son of Righteousness,
Risen Lamb of God,
Prince of Peace.
Rejected and despised,
Suffered, crucified.
This risen Lamb of God,
Jesus Christ,
Suffered hell and death
In the pow'r of righteousness;
Death is swallowed up in victory.
He's risen from the grave,
Salvation has been made.
Worthy is the Lamb that was slain.
