Be the King of this heart again,
Be the Lord of this life.
In my soul there's a cry today:
Be the King of this heart,
Be the King of this heart.
#1
Time Is Too Short to say it's okay,
To think I can live this way
For just another day.
So I'll search through the night
For the One my heart loves,
Won't stop till I've found You,
For Lord, I need to hold You close.
#2
I've stood in the desert and thirsted for You,
I've run through the city, now I won't let go:
I'm throwing myself on Your mercy, O God,
You say: 'It's all or nothing.'
I'm saying: 'Jesus have it all.'
#3
Be the light for my eyes,
Be the strength for my feet,
Be the love of my soul,
Be my everything.
Be my day and my night,
When I wake, when I sleep,
Undivided my heart will be.
