We worship and adore you, Lord,
Hear us when we call,
For there is no god above you,
You are the Lord of all.
#1
But how can we begin to express
What's on our hearts?
There are no words enough, Lord,
For us to even start.
#2
The tongues of men and angels
We need, to sing your praise,
So that we may glorify your name
Through heav'n's eternal days.
#3
There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin;
You only could unlock the gate
Of heav'n, and let us in.
So, we worship and adore you . . .
