We will raise a shout,
We will shout it out,
He is the Champion of the world.
(Repeat)
#1
The world is looking for a hero;
We know the greatest One of all:
The mighty Ruler of the nations,
King of kings and Lord of lords;
Who took the nature of a servant,
And gave His life to save us all.
#2
The Lord Almighty is our hero,
He breaks the stranglehold of sin.
Through Jesus' love we fear no evil;
Powers of darkness flee from Him.
His light will shine in every nation,
A sword of justice He will bring.
