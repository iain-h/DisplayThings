I just want to be where you are,
Dwelling daily in your presence;
I don't want to worship from afar:
Draw me near to where you are.
I just want to be where you are,
In your dwelling-place for ever;
Take me to the place where you are:
I just want to be with you.

I want to be where you are,
Dwelling in your presence,
Feasting at your table,
Surrounded by your glory,
In your presence,
That's where I always want to be:
I just want to be,
I just want to be with you.
#3
I just want to be where you are,
To enter boldly in your presence;
I don't want to worship from afar,
Draw me near to where you are.
#4
O my God, you are my strength and my song
And when I'm in your presence,
Though I'm weak, you're always strong.
I just want to be where you are,
In your dwelling-place for ever.
Take me to the place where you are:
I just want to be,
I just want to be with you;
I just want to be,
I just want to be with you.
#5
I just want to be where you are,
Dwelling daily in your presence;
I don't want to worship from afar:
Draw me near to where you are.
I just want to be where you are,
In your dwelling-place for ever;
Take me to the place where you are:
I just want to be with you.
