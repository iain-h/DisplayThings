He that is in us is greater
Than he that is in the world.
He that is in us is greater
Than he that is in the world.
#1
Therefore I will sing and I will rejoice
For His Spirit lives in me.
Christ the living one has overcome
And we share in His victory.
#2
All the powers of death and hell and sin
Lie crushed beneath His feet.
Jesus owns the name above all names,
Crowned with honour and majesty.
