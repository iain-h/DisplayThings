Christ is risen!
(Christ is risen!)
Death has been conquered.
(Death has been conquered.)
Christ is risen!
(Christ is risen!)
He shall reign for ever.
#1
In the tomb so cold they laid him,
Death its victim claimed.
Pow'rs of hell, they could not hold him;
Back to life he came!
#2
Hell had spent its fury on him,
Left him crucified.
Yet, by blood, he boldly conquered,
Sin and death defied.
#3
Now the fear of death is broken,
Love has won the crown.
Prisoners of the darkness listen,
Walls are tumbling down.
#4
Raised from death to heav'n ascending,
Love's exalted King.
Let His song of joy, unending,
Through the nations ring!
