Burn it deep within my soul,
New strength and fire, O Lord.
Burn it deep within my soul,
New zeal and fire, O Lord.
Burn it deep within my soul,
New strength and fire,
It makes me whole.
Burn it deep,
Deep within my soul.

And You came
With the Holy Spirit's desire.
You came
With a zeal for Your Father's house.
Consume me, Lord,
With Your purifying fire,
And strengthen me
By Your mighty hand.
