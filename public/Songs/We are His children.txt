Go forth in His name,
Proclaiming, 'Jesus reigns!'
Now is the time for the church to arise
And proclaim him
'Jesus, Saviour, Redeemer and Lord'.
(Repeat)
#1
We are His children,
The fruit of His suffering,
Saved and redeemed by His blood;
Called to be holy, a light to the nations:
Clothed with His power,
Filled with His love.
#2
Countless the souls
That are stumbling in darkness;
Why do we sleep in the light?
Jesus commands us to go make disciples,
This is our cause,
This is our fight.
#3
Listen, the wind
Of the Spirit is blowing,
The end of the age is so near;
Powers in the earth and heavens are shaking,
Jesus our Lord
Soon shall appear.
