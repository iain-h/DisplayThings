Jesus, what can I give,
What can I bring
To so faithful a friend,
To so loving a King?
Saviour, what can be said,
What can be sung
As a praise of your name
For the things you have done?
O my words could not tell,
Not even in part,
Of the debt of love that is owed
By this thankful heart.
#1
I will offer up my life
In spirit and truth,
Pouring out the oil of love
As my worship to you.
In surrender I must give
My every part;
Lord, receive the sacrifice
Of a broken heart.
#2
You deserve my every breath
For you've paid the great cost;
Giving up your life to death,
Even death on a cross.
You took all my shame away,
There defeated my sin,
Opened up the gates of heav'n,
And have beckoned me in.
