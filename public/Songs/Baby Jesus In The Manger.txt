Noel, noel, noel,
Hail the Immanuel.
#1
Baby Jesus in the manger,
To the world He's still a stranger.
Wise men bring their gifts
Of gold and myrrh,
Baby Jesus in the manger.
#2
Gentle Jesus, meek and lowly,
Full of love so pure and holy.
He will teach and pray,
Show mankind the way,
Gentle Jesus, meek and lowly.
#3
Loving Jesus, mocked and beaten,
He the sin of man has taken.
He has paid the price,
He has given His life,
Loving Jesus, mocked and beaten.
#4
Mighty Jesus, He is risen,
He has broken out of prison.
He has conquered sin,
Brought new life to men,
Mighty Jesus, He is risen.
