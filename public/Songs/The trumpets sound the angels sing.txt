Sing with thankfulness songs of pure delight,
Come and revel in heaven's love and light;
Take your place at the table of the King,
The feast is ready to begin,
The feast is ready to begin.
#1
The trumpets sound, the angels sing,
The feast is ready to begin;
The gates of heav'n are open wide,
And Jesus welcomes you inside.
#2
Tables are laden with good things,
O taste the peace and joy he brings;
He'll fill you up with love divine,
He'll turn your water into wine.
#3
The hungry heart he satisfies,
Offers the poor His paradise;
Now hear all heav'n and earth applaud
The amazing goodness of the Lord.
