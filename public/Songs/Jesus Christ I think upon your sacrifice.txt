And once again I look upon
The cross where you died.
I'm humbled by your mercy
And I'm broken inside.
Once again I thank you,
Once again I pour out my life.
#1
Jesus Christ, I think upon your sacrifice;
You became nothing, poured out to death.
Many times I've wondered at your gift of life,
And I'm in that place once again,
I'm in that place once again.
#2
Now you are; exalted to the highest place,
King of the heavens, where one day I'll bow.
But for now; I marvel at this saving grace,
And I'm full of praise once again,
I'm full of praise once again.
