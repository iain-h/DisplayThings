#1
Restore, O Lord,
The honour of your name,
In works of sovereign power
Come shake the earth again,
That all may see,
And come with reverent fear
To the living God,
Whose kingdom shall outlast the years.
#2
Restore, O Lord,
In all the earth your fame,
And in our time revive
The church that bears your name.
And in your anger,
Lord, remember mercy,
O living God,
Whose mercy shall outlast the years.
#3
Bend us, O Lord,
Where we are hard and cold,
In your refiner's fire:
Come purify the gold.
Though suffering comes
And evil crouches near,
Still our living God
Is reigning, he is reigning here.
