#1
Name of all majesty,
Fathomless mystery,
King of the ages
By angels adored;
Power and authority,
Splendour and dignity,
Bow to His mastery -
Jesus is Lord!
#2
Child of our destiny,
God from eternity,
Love of the Father
On sinners outpoured;
See now what God has done,
Sending His only Son,
Christ the belovèd One -
Jesus is Lord!
#3
Saviour of Calvary,
Costliest victory,
Darkness defeated
And Eden restored;
Born as a man to die,
Nailed to a cross on high,
Cold in the grave to lie -
Jesus is Lord!
#4
Source of all sovereignty,
Light, immortality,
Life everlasting
And heaven assured;
So with the ransomed, we
Praise Him eternally,
Christ in His majesty -
Jesus is Lord!
