And oh, the glory of the cross,
That You would send Your Son for us.
I gladly count my life as loss
That I might come to know
The glory of, the glory of the cross.
#1
What Wisdom Once Devised The Plan
Where all our sin and pride
Was placed upon the perfect Lamb
Who suffered, bled and died?
The wisdom of a sovereign God
Whose greatness will be shown,
When those who crucified Your Son
Rejoice around Your throne.
#2
What righteousness was there revealed
That sets the guilty free,
That justifies ungodly men
And calls the filthy clean?
A righteousness that proved to all
Your justice has been met,
And holy wrath is satisfied
Through one atoning death.
#3
What mercy now has been proclaimed
For those who would believe?
A love incomprehensible,
Our minds could not conceive.
A mercy that forgives my sin
And makes me like Your Son.
And now I'm loved forevermore,
Because of what You've done.
