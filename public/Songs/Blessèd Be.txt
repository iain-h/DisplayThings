Blessèd be the God and Father
Of our Lord Jesus Christ,
Who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing
In heavenly places in Christ.
#2
And He has chosen us
Before the world was formed
To be holy and blameless before Him.
In His love He has predestined us
To be adopted as sons
Through Jesus Christ to Himself.
