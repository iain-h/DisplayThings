I want to know the One who shines,
The One enthroned above the skies,
The One who gave His life,
Was crucified, and lifted up on high.
#1
I Want To Be Before Your Throne,
Where Your glory shines.
I want to see, I want to know
The One who saved my life.
#2
I want to know as I am known
In this space and time.
Now I am Yours, and in lover's words:
Jesus, You are mine.
#3
In You I live, in You I move
And have my being.
It's You I love,
It's You I choose to believe in.
