My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine.
For thee all the follies of sin I resign.
My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art thou.
If ever I loved thee, 
If ever I loved thee,
If ever I loved thee my Jesus, 'tis now.
#2
I love thee because thou has first loved me,
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree.
I love thee for wearing the thorns on thy brow.
If ever I loved thee, 
If ever I loved thee,
If ever I loved thee my Jesus, 'tis now.
#3
In mansions of glory and endless delight,
I'll ever adore thee in Heaven so bright.
I'll sing with a glittering crown on my brow.
If ever I loved thee, 
If ever I loved thee,
If ever I loved thee my Jesus, 'tis now.
