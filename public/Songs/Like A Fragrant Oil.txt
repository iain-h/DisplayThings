Jesus,
You alone are worthy of my praise,
I owe my life to You.
Jesus,
You alone can make me holy,
So I bow before You.
#1
Like A Fragrant Oil,
Like costly perfume poured out,
Let my worship be to You.
Like a fervent prayer,
Like incense rising to Your throne,
In spirit and in truth.
#2
Like a wedding vow,
'All I am I give to You',
Let my sacrifice be pure.
Like the sweetest sound,
Like a lover's whisper in Your ear,
I've set my heart on You.
