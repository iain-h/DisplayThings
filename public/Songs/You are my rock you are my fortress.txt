You are the invincible God,
Mighty in power and great in splendour.
You are the invincible God,
Mighty in power and great in splendour.
King of kings,
Lord of lords,
God of all the earth.
#1
You are my rock, you are my fortress,
You are my strength, I will not fear.
You are my shield and my strong tower,
You are my refuge in the storm.
#2
You are my light and my salvation,
I run to you, my hiding-place.
Your name is Jesus and you are mighty.
You are my stronghold, you are my life.
