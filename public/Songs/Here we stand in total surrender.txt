This time revival;
Lord, come and heal our land,
Bring to completion
The work that you've begun.
This time revival;
Stir up your church again,
Pour out your Spirit
On your daughters and your sons.
#1
Here we stand
In total surrender,
Lifting our voices,
Abandoned to your cause;
Here we stand,
Praying in the glory
Of the one and only
Jesus Christ, the Lord.
#2
Here we stand
In need of your mercy,
Father, forgive us
For the fire that we have lost.
Once again
Make us an army
To conquer this nation
With the message of the cross.
