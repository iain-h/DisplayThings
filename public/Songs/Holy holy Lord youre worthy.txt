Hallowed be your name,
Hallowed be your name,
Hallowed be your name,
Lord and Majesty,
Divine Authority.
Hallowed be your name.

Holy, holy, Lord, you're worthy
And I'm honoured to sing your praise.
King of glory, God Almighty,
Hallowed be your name.

All creation, every nation,
Has its being by your word;
As your will is done up in heaven,
Let it be done here on earth,
Let it be done on earth.

Holy, holy, Lord, you're worthy
And I'm honoured to sing your praise.
King of glory, God Almighty,
Hallowed be your name,
Hallowed be your name.
