#1
Be patient, be ready,
Look up - the Lord is near.
Be faithful, be fruitful,
Until the day that he appears.
Though all things are shaken
And hearts are filled with fear,
Keep working, keep praying,
Until His kingdom is here.
#2
Deep in our hearts there's a cry,
As the Spirit and Bride say:
'Come, Jesus, come, take your white horse
And ride through the heavens. Come!'
(Repeat)
