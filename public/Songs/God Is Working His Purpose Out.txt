God is working His purpose out
As year succeeds to year.
God is working His purpose out,
And the day is drawing near.
Nearer and nearer draws the time,
The time that shall surely be,
When the earth shall be filled
With the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.
#2
From the east to the utmost west
Wherever foot has trod,
Through the mouths of His messengers
Echoes forth the voice of God:
'Listen to me, ye continents,
Ye islands, give ear to me,
That the earth shall be filled
With the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.'
#3
March we forth in the strength of God,
His banner is unfurled;
Let the light of the gospel shine
In the darkness of the world:
Strengthen the weary, heal the sick
And set every captive free,
That the earth shall be filled
With the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.
#4
All our efforts are nothing worth
Unless God bless the deed;
Vain our hopes for the harvest tide
Till he brings to life the seed.
Yet ever nearer draws the time,
The time that shall surely be,
When the earth shall be filled
With the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.
