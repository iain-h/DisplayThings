O Lord, I hunger for more of you,
Rise up within me,
Let me know your truth.
O Holy Spirit, saturate my soul,
And let the life of God
Fill me now, let your healing pow'r
Bring life and make me whole
And let the peace of God, let it reign
#1
Father of life, draw me closer,
Lord, my heart is set on you;
Let me run the race of time
With your life enfolding mine
And let the peace of God, let it reign.
#2
O Holy Spirit, Lord, my comfort,
Strengthen me, hold my head up high;
And I'll stand upon your truth,
Bringing glory unto you,
And let the peace of God, let it reign.
