My chains are gone, I've been set free
My God, my Saviour, has ransomed me;
And like a flood His mercy rains,
Unending love, amazing grace
#1
Amazing grace! how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me;
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.
#2
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed!
#3
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.
#4
The Lord has promised good to me,
His Word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures
#5
When we've been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun.
