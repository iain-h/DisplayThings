Holy and mighty,
Awesome in power,
Full of compassion
And love.
Glorious in holiness,
Fearful in praises,
Working His wonders
In us.
#1
We lift up our heads,
And we will sing our praise
To Him who sits on the throne.
We lift up our heads
To the King of kings,
Who reigns in heaven and earth.
