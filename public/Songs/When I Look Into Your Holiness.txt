I worship you, I worship you,
The reason I live is to worship you.
I worship you, I worship you,
The reason I live is to worship you.
#1
When I look into your holiness,
When I gaze into your loveliness,
When all things that surround
Become shadows in the light of you;
When I've found the joy
Of reaching your heart,
When my will becomes enthralled
In your love,
When all things that surround
Become shadows in the light of you:
