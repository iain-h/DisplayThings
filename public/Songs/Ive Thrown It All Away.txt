'Take the world but give me Jesus!'
You're the treasure in this life.
'Take the world but give me Jesus!'
Is my cry.
Now I've seen You as the Saviour,
I will leave the rest behind:
'Take the world but give me Jesus!'
Is my cry.
#1
I've Thrown It All Away
That I might gain a life in You.
I've found all else is loss
Compared to the joys of knowing You.
Your beauty and Your majesty
Are far beyond compare:
You've won my heart,
Now this will be my prayer.
#2
Into the world I'll go
That I might live this life of love.
I won't be overcome,
For You are in me and You are strong.
For time and for eternity
I know I'm in Your care;
You've won my heart,
Now this will be my prayer.
