It's so good, so good
When we live together
In peace and harmony;
It's so good, so good
When we live together
In His love.
#1
How good and how pleasant it is
When we all live in unity,
Refreshing as dew at the dawn,
Like rare anointing oil upon the head.
#2
How deep are the rivers that run
When we are one in Jesus
And share with the Father and Son
The blessings of His everlasting life.
