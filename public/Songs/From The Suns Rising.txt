Let every heart, every voice,
Every tongue join with spirits ablaze;
One in His love, we will circle the world
With the song of His praise.
O, let all His people rejoice,
And let all the earth hear His voice!
#1
From the sun's rising
Unto the sun's setting,
Jesus our Lord
Shall be great in the earth;
And all earth's kingdoms
Shall be His dominion,
All of creation
Shall sing of His worth.
#2
To every tongue, tribe
And nation He sends us,
To make disciples,
To teach and baptise.
For all authority
To Him is given;
Now as His witnesses
We shall arise.
#3
Come let us join with
The church from all nations,
Cross every border,
Throw wide every door;
Workers with Him
As He gathers His harvest,
Till earth's far corners
Our Saviour adore.
