#1
Abide with me,
Fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens;
Lord, with me abide:
When other helpers fail,
And comforts flee,
Help of the helpless,
O abide with me.
#2
Swift to its close
Ebbs out life's little day;
Earth's joys grow dim,
Its glories pass away;
Change and decay
In all around I see;
O thou who changest not,
Abide with me.
#3
I need thy presence
Every passing hour;
What but thy grace
Can foil the tempter's pow'r?
Who like thyself
My guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine,
Lord, abide with me.
#4
I fear no foe
With thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight,
And tears no bitterness.
Where is death's sting?
Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still,
If thou abide with me.
#5
Hold thou thy cross
Before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom,
And point me to the skies;
Heav'n's morning breaks,
And earth's vain shadows flee;
In life, in death,
O Lord, abide with me.
