I will cry mercy,
I will cry mercy for this land, O God.
I will cry justice,
I will cry justice for this land, O God,
For this land, O God.
Let Your tears flow from my eyes;
Let Your passion melt my heart of stone.
Let Your beauty be seen in my life;
Let Your heartbeat be my own.
So I'll cry mercy for this nation,
Let us see healing for the people,
And I'll cry justice for this nation, O God.
