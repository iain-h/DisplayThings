#1
At this table we remember
How and where our faith began:
In the pain of crucifixion
Suffered by the Son of Man.
#2
Looking up in adoration
Faith is conscious - He is here!
Christ is present with His people,
His the call that draws us near.
#3
Heart and mind we each examine:
If with honesty we face
All our doubt, our fear and failure,
Then we can receive His grace.
#4
Peace we share with one another:
As from face to face we turn
In our brothers and our sisters
Jesus' body we discern.
#5
Bread and wine are set before us;
As we eat, we look ahead:
We shall dine with Christ in heaven
Where the kingdom feast is spread.
#6
Nourished by the bread of heaven,
Faith and strength and courage grow -
So to witness, serve and suffer,
Out into the world we go.
