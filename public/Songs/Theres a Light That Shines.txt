And the light shines so we can see,
And the truth came so we could know.
And the light of God is the light of men,
And His life gives life to all.
#1
There's a light that shines, a lamp that burns,
The hope, the peace of righteousness.
And You who hear the prayers of all,
You call us near to You.
There's a path that leads, a way that's true,
The life, the light, the perfect truth.
We come to You forgiven, free,
You call us near to You.
#2
No other way, no other life,
No other truth, no other light.
The way ahead is found in Christ,
You call us near to You.
We will dance and sing, for freedom comes
To heal our hearts and dry our tears.
Forever more in glorious light
You call us near to You.
