Just to be with You,
Just to know more of Your love;
Just to be with You,
And to love You.
#1
I Live My Life To Worship You,
I spend my days serving You,
And now I come, I come.
I want to spend some time with You,
To steal away and be with You,
So now I come, I come.
#2
And here You know me,
And here You know me,
And here You know me,
And here I love You.
