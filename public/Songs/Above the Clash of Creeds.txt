#1
Above the clash of creeds,
The many voices
That call on so many names,
Into these final days
Our God has spoken
By sending His only Son.
#2
Before we called he came
To earth from heaven,
Our maker became a man;
When no one else could pay,
He bought our freedom,
Exchanging His life for ours.
#3
Beneath the cross of Christ
Let earth fall silent
In awe of this mystery;
Then let this song arise
And fill the nations:
O hear him call, 'Come to me.'
#C
There is no other way
By which we must be saved;
His name is Jesus,
The only Saviour;
No other sinless life,
No other sacrifice,
In all creation
No other way.
