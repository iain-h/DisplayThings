O most high,
You who are my stronghold,
When troubles come,
You're my hiding place;
O Most High,
Those who know You trust You,
You will not forsake the ones
Who seek Your face.

I will give thanks to the Lord with all my heart,
I will sing glorious praises to Your name;
I will be glad and exalt in You, my Lord,
Yesterday, today, forever, You're the same.
