May the fragrance of Jesus fill this place
(may the fragrance of Jesus fill this place).
May the fragrance of Jesus fill this place
(lovely fragrance of Jesus),
Rising from the sacrifice
Of lives laid down in adoration.
#2
May the glory of Jesus fill His church
(may the glory of Jesus fill His church).
May the glory of Jesus fill His church
(radiant glory of Jesus),
Shining from our faces
As we gaze in adoration.
#3
May the beauty of Jesus fill my life
(may the beauty of Jesus fill my life).
May the beauty of Jesus fill my life
(perfect beauty of Jesus),
Fill my thoughts, my words, my deeds;
May I give in adoration.
Fill my thoughts, my words, my deeds;
May I give in adoration.
