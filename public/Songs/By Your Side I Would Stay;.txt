#1
By Your side I would stay;
In Your arms I would lay,
Jesus Lover of my Soul,
Nothing from You I withhold.
#2
Lord I love You, and adore you;
What more can I say?
You cause my love to grow stronger
With every passing day
Lord I love You, and adore you;
What more can I say?
You cause my love to grow stronger
With every passing day
