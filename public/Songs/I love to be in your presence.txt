#C
I love to be in your presence
With your people singing praises;
I love to stand and rejoice,
Lift my hands and raise my voice.
(Repeat)
#1
You set my feet to dancing,
You fill my heart with song,
You give me reason to rejoice, rejoice.
#2
(Last time)
Lift my hands, lift my hands,
Lift my hands and raise my voice.
