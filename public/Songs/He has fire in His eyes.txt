And we say, 'Yes, Lord,
We will ride with you.
We will stand up and fight.
We will ride with the armies of heaven,
We'll be dressed in white
(we'll be dressed in white).'
And we say, 'Yes, yes, Lord, we will ride.'

He has fire in His eyes
And a sword in His hand
And he's riding a white horse
Across this land.
He has fire in His eyes
And a sword in His hand,
He's riding a white horse
All across this land.
And he's calling out to you and me,
'Will you ride with me?'

He has fire in His eyes
And a sword in His hand
And he's riding a white horse
Across this land.
And he's calling out to you and me,
'Will you ride with me?'
And we say, 'Yes, yes, Lord,
We will ride with you.'
#3
He has a crown on His head,
He carries a sceptre in His hand
And he's leading the armies
Across this land.
And he's calling out to you and me,
'Will you ride with me?'
And we say, 'Yes, yes, Lord,
We will ride with you.'
#4
And that fire in His eyes
Is His love for His bride,
And he's longing that she be with him,
Right by His side.
That fire in His eyes
Is His burning desire
That His bride be with him,
Right by His side.
And he's calling out to us right now,
'Will you ride with me?'
