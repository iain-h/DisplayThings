#1
You love me as you found me;
Your love keeps following me.
You wrapped your arms around me,
Your love keeps following me.
By grace I'm what I should be;
Your love keeps following me.
You saw me as I could be;
Your love keeps following me.

And it's higher (reaches from heaven to man),
It's wider (anyone can come in),
It's deeper (it covers any sin),
And I know
This one thing:
Wherever I go
I know
Your love keeps following me.
