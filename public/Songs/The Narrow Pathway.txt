#1
The Narrow Pathway
Through the needle's eye,
I'm stepping forward
To the place I die.
#2
For I know that You are faithful,
As we walk these fields of white.
To the waiting and the humble
Your kingdom comes.
#3
The way of mercy
Takes me to the least,
Down the road of suffering
To the wedding feast.
For I know that You are faithful,
As we walk these fields of white.
To the weary and the hurting
Your kingdom comes.
