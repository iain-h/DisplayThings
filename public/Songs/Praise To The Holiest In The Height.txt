#1
Praise to the holiest in the height,
And in the depth be praise;
In all His words most wonderful,
Most sure in all His ways.
#2
O wisest love! that flesh and blood,
Which did in Adam fail,
Should strive afresh against the foe,
Should strive and should prevail;
#3
And that a higher gift than grace
Should flesh and blood refine,
God's presence and His very self,
And essence all-divine.
#4
O generous love! that He, who smote
In Man for man the foe,
The double agony in Man
For man should undergo;
#5
And in the garden secretly,
And on the cross on high,
Should teach His brethren, and inspire
To suffer and to die.
#6
Praise to the Holiest in the height,
And to the depth be praise;
In all His words most wonderful,
Most sure in all His ways.
