Shout unto God with a voice of triumph,
Sing and proclaim His mighty name.
Shout unto God with a voice of triumph,
Sing and proclaim that our God reigns.
(Repeat)
#1
He is Lord over all the nation,
He is Lord over all the earth.
With high praises we shall sing
All the honour to the King.
With a two-edged sword in our hand
We are marching on to take the land.
#2
He is Lord over all the nation,
He is Lord over all the earth.
We shall go out in one accord,
In the power of God's Word.
We proclaim liberty,
In Christ Jesus the victory.
