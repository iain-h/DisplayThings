I believe there is a God in heaven
Who paid the price for all my sin;
Shed His blood to open up the way
For me to walk with Him.
Gave His life upon a cross,
Took the punishment for us,
Offered up Himself in love,
Jesus, Jesus.
#2
'It is finished' was His cry;
Not even death could now deny
The Son of God exalted high,
Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus.
