How wonderful, how glorious
Is the love of God,
Bringing healing, forgiveness,
Wonderful love.
#1
Let celebration echo through this land;
We bring reconciliation,
We bring hope to every man:
#2
We proclaim the kingdom
Of our God is here;
Come and join the heavenly anthem,
Ringing loud and ringing clear:
#3
Listen to the music
As His praises fill the air;
With joy and with gladness
Tell the people everywhere:
