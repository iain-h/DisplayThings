My chains fell off my heart was free
I'm alive to live for you, I'm alive to live for you
Amazing Love, how can it be?
You give everything for me, you give everything for me
Everything
#1
I am chosen, I am free
I am living for eternity
Free now forever
You picked me up, turned me around
You set my feet on solid ground
Yours now forever
#2
You washed my sin and shame away
The slate is clean: a brand new day
Free now forever
Now boldly I approach your throne
To claim this crown through Christ my own
Yours now forever

And nothing's gonna hold me back
Nothing's gonna hold me back
Nothing's gonna hold me back
