And I love You for the cross,
I'm overwhelmed by the mystery.
I love You for the cost,
That Jesus, You would do this for me.
When You were broken, You were beaten,
You were punished, I go free.
When You were wounded and rejected,
In Your mercy, I am healed.

I Will Love You For The Cross,
And I will love You for the cost:
Man of sufferings,
Bringer of my peace.
You came into a world of shame,
And paid the price we could not pay:
Death that brought me life,
Blood that brought me home.
Death that brought me life,
Blood that brought me home.

Jesus Christ, the sinner's friend;
Does this kindness know no bounds?
With Your precious blood
You have purchased me.
O the mystery of the cross,
You were punished, You were crushed;
But that punishment
Has become my peace.
Yes, that punishment
Has become my peace.
