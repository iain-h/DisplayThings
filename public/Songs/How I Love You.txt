How I love You,
You are the One,
You are the One.
How I love You,
You are the One for me.
#1
I was so lost,
But You showed the way,
'Cause You are the Way.
I was so lost,
But You showed the way to me!
#2
I was lied to,
But You told the truth,
'Cause You are the Truth.
I was lied to,
But You showed the truth to me!
#3
I was dying,
But You gave me life,
'Cause You are the Life.
I was dying,
And You gave Your life for me!
#4
Hallelujah!
You are the One,
You are the One.
Hallelujah!
You are the One for me!
#5
How I love You,
You are the One,
You are the One.
How I love You,
You are the One,
God's risen Son.
You are the One for me!
