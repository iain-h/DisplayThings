Power from on high,
Power from on high,
Lord, we are waiting
For power from on high.
Power from on high,
Power from on high,
Lord, we are waiting
For power from on high.
#1
May we taste Your heaven
Here on the earth,
May Your Spirit bring us new birth.
#2
May we take Your heaven
To those on the earth,
May Your Spirit bring them new birth.
#3
May the truth and power
Of life that You give
Very soon be ours to live.
