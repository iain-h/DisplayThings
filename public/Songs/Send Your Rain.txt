#1
Send Your rain down from the heavens;
Send Your rain to this earth.
Let there be a great outpouring;
Holy Spirit, come to us.
#2
Send Your fire down from the heavens;
The fire of revival to Your church.
We can see the world is waiting;
Holy Spirit, come to us.
#3
Fill this land with Your grace and mercy;
Cause our hearts to worship You.
