Be my everything, be my everything

God in my living, there in my breathing
God in my waking, God in my sleeping
God in my resting, there in my working
God in my thinking,  God in my speaking
#2
God in my hoping, there in my dreaming
God in my watching, God in my waiting
God in my laughing, there in my weeping
God in my hurting, God in my healing
