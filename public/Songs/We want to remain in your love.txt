#1
We want to remain in your love,
We want to remain in your love.
O Lord, O Lord, we need you so.
I want to remain in your love,
I want to remain in your love.
O Lord, don't ever let us go.
(Repeat)
#2
Love is patient, love is kind,
Does not envy, does not boast,
Is not proud, is not rude;
Love does not rejoice in evil,
But rejoices with the truth.
Love protects, always trusts,
Always hopes, and perseveres,
Is slow to anger, never fails;
Love does not delight in evil,
But rejoices with the truth.
Love does not delight in evil,
But rejoices with the truth.
#3
I want to remain in your love,
I want to remain in your love.
O Lord, don't ever let us go.
