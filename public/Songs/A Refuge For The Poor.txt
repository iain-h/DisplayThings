Oh, mmm, this is our God.
Oh, mmm, this is our God.
#1
A refuge for the poor,
A shelter from the storm:
This is our God.
He will wipe away your tears
And return your wasted years:
This is our God.
#2
A Father to the orphan,
A healer to the broken:
This is our God.
He brings peace to our madness
And comfort in our sadness:
This is our God.
#3
A fountain for the thirsty,
A lover for the lonely:
This is our God.
He brings glory to the humble
And crowns for the faithful:
This is our God.
#4
This is the One we have waited for,
This is the One we have waited for,
This is the One we have waited for.
