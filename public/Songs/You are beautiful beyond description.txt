And I stand, I stand in awe of You.
I stand, I stand in awe of You.
Holy God to whom all praise is due.
I stand in awe of You

You are beautiful beyond description.
Too marvellous for words.
Too wonderful for comprehension.
Like nothing ever seen or heard.
Who can grasp your infinite wisdom?
Who can fathom the depth of your love?
You are beautiful beyond description.
Majesty, enthroned above.
