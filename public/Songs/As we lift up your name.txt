Revival fire, fall, revival fire, fall,
Fall on us here in the pow'r of your Spirit,
Father, let revival fire fall;
Revival fire, fall, revival fire, fall,
Let the flames consume us
With hearts ablaze for Jesus.
Father, let revival fire fall.
#1
Leader:	As we lift up your name,
All:	as we lift up your name,
Leader:	let your fire fall,
All:	let your fire fall;
Leader:	send your wind and your rain,
All:	send your wind and your rain,
Leader:	on your wings of love,
All:	on your wings of love.
Pour out from heaven
Your passion and presence,
Bring down your burning desire.

Leader:	As we lift up your name,
All:	as we lift up your name,
Leader:	let your kingdom come,
All:	let your kingdom come;
Leader:	have your way in this place,
All:	have your way in this place,
Leader:	let your will be done,
All:	let your will be done.
Pour out from heaven
Your passion and presence,
Bring down your burning desire.
