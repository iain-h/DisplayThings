#1
I'm special because God has loved me,
For he gave the best thing that he had to save me;
His own Son, Jesus,
Crucified to take the blame,
For all the bad things I have done.
Thank you, Jesus,
Thank you, Lord,
For loving me so much.
I know I don't deserve anything;
Help me feel your love right now
To know deep in my heart
That I'm your special friend.
