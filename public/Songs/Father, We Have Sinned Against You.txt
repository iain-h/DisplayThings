#1
Father, We Have Sinned Against You,
Failed to do what's right;
We have walked alone in darkness,
Hiding from the light.
Father, we have run away
From what we know is true;
Now we turn around and we are
Coming home to You.
#2
We have sinned, (we have sinned)
We have broken Your law,
We're returning once more home to You;
We have sinned, (we have sinned)
We are seeking Your face,
We return by Your grace home to You.
