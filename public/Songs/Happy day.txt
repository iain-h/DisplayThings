Oh, happy day, happy day
You washed my sin away
Oh, happy day, happy day
I'll never be the same
Forever I am changed
#1
The greatest day in history
Death is beaten, you have rescued me
Sing it out, Jesus is alive
The empty cross, the empty grave
Life eternal, you have won the day
Shout it out, Jesus is alive
He's alive!
#2
When I stand in that place, free at last
Meeting face to face
I am yours, Jesus you are mine
Endless joy, perfect peace
Earthly pain finally will cease
Celebrate, Jesus is alive
He's alive!

Oh, what a glorious day, what a glorious way
That you have saved me
Oh, what a glorious day, what a glorious name
