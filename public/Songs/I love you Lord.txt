And we cry, 'Holy, holy is your name.'
We sing, 'Glory to the Lamb that was slain.'
We cry, 'Holy, holy is your name,
Holy is your name,
Holy is your name.'
#1
I love you, Lord, with all of my heart.
I love you, Lord, with all of my soul.
Let all that is within me
Cry, 'Holy is your name.'
Let all that is within me
Cry, 'Holy is your name.'
#2
I love you, Lord, with all of my mind.
I love you, Lord, with all of my strength.
Let all that is within me
Cry, 'Holy is your name.'
Let all that is within me
Cry, 'Holy is your name.'
