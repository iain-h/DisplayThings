#C
There is none like you,
No one else can touch my heart like you do.
I could search for all eternity long
And find there is none like you.
(Repeat)
#1
Your mercy flows like a river wide,
And healing comes from your hands.
Suffering children are safe in your arms;
There is none like you.
