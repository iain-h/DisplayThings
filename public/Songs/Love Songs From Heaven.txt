For You we live,
And for You we may die;
Through us may Jesus be seen.
For You alone we will offer our lives;
In this dark world our light will shine.
#1
Love songs from heaven are filling the earth,
Bringing great hope to all nations.
Evil has prospered, but truth is alive;
In this dark world the light still shines.
#2
Nothing has silenced this gospel of Christ;
It echoes down through the ages.
Blood of the martyrs has made Your church strong;
In this dark world the light still shines.
#3
Let every nation be filled with Your song:
This is the cry of Your people.
We will not settle for anything less,
In this dark world our light must shine.
