Before You, Lord, forgiven,
We bow before Your throne.
At Your cross, we find in You
Our righteousness restored.
Before You, Lord, forgiven,
We stand in Your great love,
And live our lives in honour
To Your forgiving blood.
#1
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord,
God of power and might.
Earth and heaven worship You,
Your majesty so bright.
Yet we, Your fallen children know
Your love beyond compare.
We lift our hands, surrender
To grace so undeserved.
#2
Living in Your presence, Lord,
Sin and guilt atoned;
Citizens of heaven,
Heirs unto Your throne.
To be with You in glory,
To see You face to face,
At last home with the Father,
Our holy dwelling place.
