Send a revival, send a revival,
Send a revival, we pray.
Send a revival, send a revival,
Send a revival, we pray.
#1
One Voice, one mind, one will to see
The heart of God revealed in power.
Let every nation, tribe and tongue
Come seek the Lord and His great love.
#2
We will not cease, we will not rest
Until the Prince of Peace is seen.
As God with us, Emmanuel,
The hope of all humanity.
#3
A vision burns within my soul
That all the world will come to know
The healing found at Calvary,
That place where truth and mercy meet.
#4
I hear a sound across the earth;
It tells me that the time is near.
An anthem lifting up His name:
Make straight a path - prepare the way.
