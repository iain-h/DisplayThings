How good it is to be loved by You,
How good it is.
(Repeat)
#1
O God Of Love, I come to You again,
Knowing I'll find mercy.
I can't explain all the things I see,
But I'll trust in You.
In every moment You are there,
Watching over, You hear my prayer.
You go before me, You're behind me,
Nothing's hidden from You.
#2
O God of strength,
Your hand is on my life,
Bringing peace to me.
You know my frame,
You know how I am made,
You planned all my days.
Hand of mercy, hand of love,
Giving power to overcome.
If all beneath me falls away,
I know that You are God.
#3
Who can stand against us?
In my weakness You are strong.
Your word is everlasting,
I will praise You, faithful One.
