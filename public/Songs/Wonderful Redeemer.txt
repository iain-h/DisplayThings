Sing to the Lord our God,
Lift up His name and exalt Him.
Your holiness is immense,
And we Your people will worship
Your name forever.

Wonderful Redeemer all my life,
Thank You for the grace You have shown to me.
Nothing can compare to Your heart of love,
I have Your eyes.
#2
Righteous and majestic King of truth,
All mankind will one day bow the knee to You.
May our lives reflect the heart of You, O Lord,
We will live for You.
