There is power in the name of Jesus
To break every chain
To break every chain
To break every chain
#1
All sufficient sacrifice
so freely given, such a price
bought our redemption, Heaven's gates
swing wide
#2
There's an army rising up
To break every chain
To break every chain
To break every chain
