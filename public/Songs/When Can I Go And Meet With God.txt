Where deep calls to deep
In the roar of Your waterfalls,
You're calling me
With the force of Your love.
Let Your waves sweep
Over all the dry places, Lord;
Usher me in to the depths of Your heart,
Where deep calls to deep,
Where deep calls to deep,
Where deep calls to deep,
Where deep calls to deep.
#1
When can I go and meet with God?
My soul is weak, my body tired.
Can it be here, can it be now?
I need to find that place again.
#2
When can I come and meet You, God?
I thirst inside for heaven's touch.
Let it be here, let it be now;
I need to find that place again.
#3
I want to know Your risen power.
I need to share Your sufferings;
And as I die to my own will,
Lord, raise me to that place again.
