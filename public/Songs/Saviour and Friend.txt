You are holy
King of glory
Gave Your life for me
My Saviour and my friend
#1
There's no greater sacrifice
Than laying down a blameless life
You became sin for me
My Saviour and my friend
#2
An angry cross, a crimson tide
The Son of God there crucified
You became sin for me
My Saviour and my friend
#3
Chose to bear my guilt my shame
My darkest thoughts, my spear of pain
You became sin for me
My Saviour and my friend
#4
There's no thing that I could give
But live to die and die to live
You became endless grace
That loves me 'til the end
