No other name but the name of Jesus,
No other name but the name of the Lord;
No other name but the name of Jesus
Is worthy of glory,
And worthy of honour,
And worthy of power and all praise.
#1
His name is exalted far above the earth.
His name is high above the heavens;
His name is exalted far above the earth;
Give glory and honour and praise unto His name.
