And I will seek after You,
Forsake everything that is distracting me
From this searching,
And run to the place
Where my heart only hears the beat
Of Your love for this world.
#1
Love Like A Jewel has come down,
Most precious gem
In heaven's crown.
Love like a jewel has come down,
The greatest treasure
That I have found.
#2
Love like a jewel has come down,
You walk with the hurting,
You're a friend to the poor.
Love like a jewel has come down,
Our greatest treasure,
Where hope can be found.
