Come and satisfy,
Come and satisfy my soul.
Come and satisfy,
Come and satisfy my soul
And make me whole.
#1
Father, like rain from the skies,
Send Your word into our lives.
We cry out: 'Show us Your way,
Come to us, Father, we pray.'
#2
When will our hearts understand,
You have our lives in Your hand?
We cry out: 'Come to us, Lord,
Guide us we pray with Your word.'
