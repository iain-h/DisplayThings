Glorious, the greatest of all
Jesus is, Jesus is
Evermore, the king above all
Jesus is, Jesus is
#1
Glory, glory all around
As the universe resounds
And we proclaim that He is Lord
Eternity echoes the song
Creation joining in as one and
We proclaim that He is Lord
#2
Heavens cry, my heart sings
Jesus is
Lord of all, Heaven and Earth
Jesus is
