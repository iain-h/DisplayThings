Alleluia, alleluia,
Give thanks to the risen Lord,
Alleluia, alleluia,
Give praise to His name.

Jesus is Lord of all the earth,
He is the King of creation.

Spread the good news o'er all the earth,
Jesus has died and has risen.

We have been crucified with Christ,
Now we shall live for ever.

God has proclaimed the just reward,
Life for us all, alleluia!

Come, let us praise the living God,
Joyfully sing to our Saviour.
