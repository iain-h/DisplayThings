You bring times of refreshing,
You bring times of refreshing,
You bring times of refreshing to my soul.
When I'm weary from the fight,
And trying to do what's right,
You bring times of refreshing to my soul.

Well, I thank You, Lord,
That You are my Saviour;
You're my strength
And You're the Rock on which I stand.
You give me life,
And a grace that's greater,
When I humble myself
Beneath Your mighty hand.

For the day will come
When we'll all be gathered,
And the sun will rise with healing in its wings;
And all the years of pain
Won't seem to matter,
When our eyes behold
Our Teacher and our King.
