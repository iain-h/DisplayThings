#1
Holiness is Your life in me,
Making me clean through Your blood.
Holiness is Your fire in me,
Purging my heart like a flood.
I know You are perfect in holiness.
Your life in me, setting me free,
Making me holy.
#2
Only the blood of Jesus covers all of my sin.
Only the life of Jesus renews me from within.
Your blood is enough, Your mercy complete.
Your work of atonement, paid for my debts,
Making me holy.
Only the blood of Jesus.
