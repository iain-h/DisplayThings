O Jesus, I have promised
To serve thee to the end;
Be thou for ever near me,
My Master and my friend:
I shall not fear the battle
If thou art by my side,
Nor wander from the pathway
If thou wilt be my guide.
#2
O let me feel thee near me:
The world is ever near;
I see the sights that dazzle,
The tempting sounds I hear;
My foes are ever near me,
Around me and within;
But, Jesus, draw thou nearer,
And shield my soul from sin.
#3
O let me hear thee speaking
In accents clear and still,
Above the storms of passion,
The murmurs of self-will;
O speak to reassure me,
To hasten or control;
O speak and make me listen,
Thou guardian of my soul.
#4
O Jesus, thou hast promised
To all that follow thee,
That where thou art in glory
There shall thy servants be;
And, Jesus, I have promised
To serve thee to the end:
O give me grace to follow,
My Master and my friend.
#5
O let me see thy footmarks,
And in them plant my own;
My hope to follow duly
Is in thy strength alone:
O guide me, call me, draw me,
Uphold me to the end;
And then in heav'n receive me,
My Saviour and my friend,
And then in heav'n receive me,
My Saviour and my friend.
