Jesus, O Jesus,
Come and fill Your lambs.
Jesus, O Jesus,
Come and fill Your lambs.
#1
O let the Son of God enfold You
With His Spirit and His love,
Let Him fill your heart and satisfy your soul.
O let Him have the things that hold you,
And His Spirit like a dove
Will descend upon your life and make you whole.
#2
O come and sing this song with gladness
As your hearts are filled with joy,
Lift your hands in sweet surrender to His name.
O give Him all your tears and sadness,
Give Him all your years of pain,
And you'll enter into life in Jesus' name.
