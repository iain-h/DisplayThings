We await a Saviour from heaven,
And he will surely come,
In His glory and with the angels
And the power of this throne.
The Christ from heaven returning,
His promise to fulfil
Before the splendour of His presence,
Let the earth be still.
#1
The Word made flesh, full of truth and grace,
The light of men, God incarnate came.
He lived, he loved, a servant, humble, meek,
And in His voice we hear the Father speak.
#2
Such hate, such scorn, and a traitor's kiss
Led to the cross for such a world as this.
The death he died, the grave in which he laid
Could not hold him; to life again he came.
#3
Now death destroyed, the grave left open wide,
Our Saviour reigns at the Father's side.
Where death your sting, where your power, O grave?
The Son of God prepares to come again.
