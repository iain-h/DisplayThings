Jesus, King of our lives, as once they came
To hear Your life-sustaining words,
We gather now with hungry hearts
Your living truth alone can fill.
#1
King Of Our Lives, Your favour rests
On all who know their need of God,
And You will comfort those who mourn.
The humble meek possess the earth,
Your mighty word turns upside down
All that this world considers great.
#2
King of our lives, the pure in heart
Will know the joy of seeing God,
So purify us deep within:
Our thoughts, our words, the things we do,
Your searching word turns inside out -
So touch our hearts and make us clean.
#3
Jesus, we come, sit at Your feet,
Yield You our lives that we may be
Salt of the earth, light of the world.
All of our cares we give to You,
All that we need our Father gives,
So we will put Your kingdom first.
#4
(Final chorus)
King of our lives, as once they came
To hear Your life-transforming word,
We ask You now to rule our hearts
With living words, to do Your will.
#5
King of our lives, Teacher.
Rule in our hearts, Saviour.
King of our lives, Messiah.
Rule in our hearts, Master,
Healer and Friend.
