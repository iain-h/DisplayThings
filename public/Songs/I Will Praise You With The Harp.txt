O Holy one of israel, (x3)
My lips will shout for joy,
My lips will shout for joy.
When I sing my praise to You, (x3)
For I have been redeemed,
I have been redeemed!
I'll speak of all Your righteous acts, (x3)
And tell them all day long,
And tell them all day long.
#1
I will praise You with the harp
For Your faithfulness, O my God.
I will sing my praise to You
With the lyre, with the lyre.
#2
Those who want to harm me
Are put to shame and confused.
I will sing my praise to You
With the lyre, with the lyre.
I've been redeemed, I've been redeemed!
I've been redeemed, I've been redeemed!
