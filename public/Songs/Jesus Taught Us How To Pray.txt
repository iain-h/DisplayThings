Jesus Taught Us How To Pray:
Father, hallowed be Your name.
Would You give us what we need,
And forgive our foolish ways?
#2
I know Jesus only prayed,
Father, what You had ordained.
#3
Let Your kingdom come on earth, Lord, as we pray.
Let Your will be done to glorify Your name.
Let the kingdom that we live for
Be revealed in us today.
Can I see heaven, can I see heaven
Here on earth today?
