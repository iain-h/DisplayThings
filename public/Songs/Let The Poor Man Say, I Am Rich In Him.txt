#1
Let The Poor Man Say, I Am Rich In Him;
Let the lost man say I am found in Him:
Let the river flow.
Let the blind man say, I can see again;
Let that dead man say, I am born again:
Let the river flow.
#2
Let the river flow,
Let the river flow,
Let the river flow.
Holy Spirit, come;
Move in power.
Let the river flow.
(Let the river flow)
