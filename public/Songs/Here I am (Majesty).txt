Majesty, Majesty
Your grace has found me just as I am,
Empty handed but alive in your hands.
#1
Here I am humbled by your majesty
Covered by your grace so free.
Here I am knowing I'm a sinful man
Covered by the blood of the lamb.
Now I've found the greatest love of all, is mine.
Since you laid down your life
The greatest sacrifice.
#2
Here I am humbled by the love that you give
Forgiven so that I can forgive.
Here I stand knowing that I'm your desire
Sanctified by glory and fire.
Now I've found the greatest love of all, is mine
Since you laid down your life
The greatest sacrifice.

Majesty, Majesty
Your grace has found me just as I am,
Empty handed but alive in your hands.
Majesty, Majesty
Forever I am changed by your love,
In the beauty of your Majesty.

Majesty, Majesty
Your grace has found me just as I am,
Empty handed but alive in your hands.
Majesty, Majesty
Forever I am changed by your love,
In the presence of your Majesty.
