Mighty is the Lord and most worthy of praise,
Praise Him all you people.
Look upon Him, God alone who saves:
Praise the Lord of all.
Nations will rise and nations will fall,
Praise Him all you people.
But there is One who is Lord of all:
Praise the Lord of all.

Awesome and great, like the strongest tower,
Praise Him all you people.
He is the one with limitless power,
Praise the Lord of all.
Leaders may come and presidents fall,
Praise Him all you people.
But there is One who is Lord of all:
Praise the Lord of all.
