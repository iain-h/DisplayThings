#1
Jesus is Lord of all,
Satan is under His feet,
Jesus is reigning on high
And all power is given to Him
In heaven and earth.
#2
We are joined to Him,
Satan is under our feet,
We are seated on high
And all authority is given
To us through Him.
#3
One day we'll be like Him,
Perfect in every way,
Chosen to be His bride,
Ruling and reigning with Him
Forever more.
