A light to be my guide,
The Father's presence at my side.
In Your will my rest I find.
O for a closer walk with God,
Leading to the Lamb.
#1
O For A Closer Walk With God,
A calm and heavenly frame.
A light that shines upon the road,
Leading to the Lamb.
#2
Where is the blessèdness I knew
When I once saw the Lord?
Where is the soul refreshing view
Living in His word?
#3
So shall my walk be close with God
With all the hopes made new.
So purer light shall mark the road
Leading to the Lamb.
