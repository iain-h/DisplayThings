#1
I will wave my hands
In praise and adoration,
I will wave my hands
In praise and adoration,
I will wave my hands
In praise and adoration,
Praise and adoration to the living God.

For he's given me hands
That just love clapping:
One, two, one, two, three,
And he's given me a voice
That just loves shouting:
'hallelujah!'
#3
He's given me feet
That just love dancing:
One, two, one, two, three,
And he's put me in a being
That has no trouble seeing
That whatever I am feeling
He is worthy to be praised.
