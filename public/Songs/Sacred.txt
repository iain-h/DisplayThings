And oh, my grateful heart rejoices at Your name.
And oh, my grateful heart rejoices at Your name.
#1
Sacred, holy, pure,
Lord of space and time,
Dwells in perfect light,
Radiance sublime.
Sacred holy songs
Rise on wings of praise;
All creation rings
With echoes of Your grace.
#2
Sacred, risen Son,
Peerless Lamb of God;
Mercy, grace and peace
Rolling like a flood.
Promise forged in pain,
Forgiveness bought by blood;
Sealed with sacred words
From the mouth of God.
