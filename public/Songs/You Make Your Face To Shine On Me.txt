When mountains fall I'll stand
By the power of your hand
And in your heart of hearts I'll dwell,
And that my soul knows very well.
#1
You make your face to shine on me,
And that my soul knows very well.
You lift me up, I'm cleansed and free,
And that my soul knows very well.
#2
Joy and strength each day I find,
And that my soul knows very well.
Forgiveness, hope, I know is mine,
And that my soul knows very well.
