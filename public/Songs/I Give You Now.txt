Go, go into the world,
Tell them I'm alive,
Go into the streets,
Tell them that I live,
Ooh, that I live in you.
Go, go into the world,
Claim it for your King,
Go into the streets,
Dry those people's tears,
Ooh, make the old things new.
#1
I give You now all I have;
I give to you My everything.
You have the power inside of you
To overcome all the hosts of darkness.
