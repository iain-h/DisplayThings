Father God, we worship you,
Make us part of all you do.
As you move among us now,
We worship you.

Jesus King, we worship you,
Help us listen now to you.
As you move among us now,
We worship you.

Spirit pure, we worship you,
With your fire our zeal renew.
As you move among us now,
We worship you.
