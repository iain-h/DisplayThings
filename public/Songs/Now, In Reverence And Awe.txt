Teach me,
Open my eyes with truth to free me,
Light to chase the lies.
Lord Jesus, let me meet You in Your word;
Lord Jesus, let me meet You in Your word.
#1
Now, In Reverence And Awe
We gather round Your word;
In wonder we draw near
To mysteries that angels strain to hear,
That prophets dimly saw:
So let Your Spirit
Shine upon the page and...
#2
Lord, Your truth cannot be chained,
It searches everything -
My secrets, my desires.
Your word is like a hammer and a fire,
It breaks, it purifies:
So let Your Spirit
Shine into my heart and...
