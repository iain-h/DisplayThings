O Breath of Life, come sweeping through us,
Revive your church with life and pow'r;
O Breath of Life, come cleanse, renew us,
And fit your church to meet this hour.
#2
O Breath of Love, come breathe within us,
Renewing thought and will and heart;
Come, love of Christ, afresh to win us,
Revive your church in every part!
#3
O Wind of God, come bend us, break us,
Till humbly we confess our need;
Then, in your tenderness remake us,
Revive, restore û for this we plead.
#4
Revive us, Lord; is zeal abating
While harvest fields are vast and white?
Revive us, Lord, the world is waiting û
Equip thy church to spread the light.
