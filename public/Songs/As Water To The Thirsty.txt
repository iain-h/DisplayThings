#1
As water to the thirsty,
As beauty to the eyes,
As strength that follows weakness,
As truth instead of lies;
As songtime and springtime
And summertime to be,
So is my Lord,
My living Lord,
So is my Lord to me.
#2
Like calm in place of clamour,
Like peace that follows pain,
Like meeting after parting,
Like sunshine after rain;
Like moonlight and starlight
And sunlight on the sea,
So is my Lord,
My living Lord,
So is my Lord to me.
#3
As sleep that follows fever,
As gold instead of grey,
As freedom after bondage,
As sunrise to the day;
As home to the traveller
And all he longs to see,
So is my Lord,
My living Lord,
So is my Lord to me.
