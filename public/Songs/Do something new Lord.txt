#C
Do something new, Lord,
In my heart, make a start;
Do something new, Lord,
Do something new.
#1
I open up my heart,
As much as can be known;
I open up my will
To conform to yours alone.
#2
I lay before your feet
All my hopes and desires;
Unreservedly submit
To what your Spirit may require.
#3
I only want to live
For your pleasure now;
I long to please you, Father -
Will you show me how?
