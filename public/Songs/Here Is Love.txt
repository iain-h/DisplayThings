Here is love, vast as the ocean,
Loving kindness as the flood,
When the Prince of life, our ransom
Shed for us His precious blood.
Who His love will not remember?
Who can cease to sing His praise?
He can never be forgotten
Throughout heaven's eternal days.

On the Mount of Crucifixion
Fountains opened deep and wide;
Through the floodgates of God's mercy
Flowed a vast and gracious tide.
Grace and love, like mighty rivers,
Poured incessant from above,
And heaven's peace and perfect justice
Kissed a guilty world in love.
#3
Let me all Your love accepting,
Love You ever, all my days;
Let me seek Your kingdom only,
And my life be to Your praise.
You alone shall be my glory,
Nothing in the world I see.
You have cleansed and sanctified me,
You Yourself have set me free.
#4
In Your Truth You will direct me,
by Your Spirit, through your Word;
And Your grace my need is meeting
As I trust in You, my Lord.
Of Your fullness You are pouring
Your great love and power on me;
Without measure, full and boundless,
As I yield myself to Thee.
