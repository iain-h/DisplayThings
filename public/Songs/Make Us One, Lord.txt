Make us one, Lord, make us one, Lord,
By Your Spirit, make us one, Lord.
We are members of one body,
Make us one, Lord, we pray.

Every tribe and nation
Is represented here,
Watching with each other
As the day of Christ draws near;
Worshipping the Saviour
Who died to set us free,
We belong together;
We are family.
