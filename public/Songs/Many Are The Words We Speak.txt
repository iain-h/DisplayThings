Help us live the life,
Help us live the life.
All we want to do
Is bring You something real,
Bring You something true.
#1
Many Are The Words We Speak,
Many are the songs we sing;
Many kinds of offerings,
But now to live the life.
(Repeat)
#2
(We hope that)
Precious are the words we speak,
(We pray that)
Precious are the songs we sing;
Precious all these offerings,
But now to live the life.
#3
Now to go the extra mile,
Now to turn the other cheek,
And to serve You with a life.
Let us share Your fellowship,
Even of Your sufferings;
Never let the passion die.
