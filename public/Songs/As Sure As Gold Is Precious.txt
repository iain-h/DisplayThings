I can hear that thunder in the distance,
Like a train on the edge of the town;
I can feel the brooding of Your Spirit:
'Lay your burdens down, lay your burdens down.'
#1
As sure as gold is precious and the honey sweet,
So You love this city and You love these streets.
Every child out playing by their own front door;
Every baby lying on the bedroom floor.
#2
Every dreamer dreaming in her dead-end job;
Every driver driving through the rush hour mob.
I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones,
You're going to send revival,
Bring them all back home.
#3
From the preacher preaching when the well is dry,
To the lost soul reaching for a higher high.
From the young man working through his hopes and fears,
To the widow walking through the vale of tears.
#4
Every man and woman, every old and young;
Every father's daughter, every mother's son.
I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones,
You're going to send revival,
Bring them all back home.
#B
Revive us, revive us,
Revive us with Your fire!
(Repeat)
