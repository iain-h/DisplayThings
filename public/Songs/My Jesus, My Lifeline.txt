Oh Jesus, oh Jesus,
I've never known a love like this before.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus,
Accept this love I give to You,
It's all I can do.
#1
My Jesus, my lifeline,
I need You more than I've ever known.
There's no one quite like You,
I'm crying out for Your loving.
#2
I'm searching, I'm longing,
Please meet me just as You want to.
I'll stand here to offer,
Offer up this song of love to You.
