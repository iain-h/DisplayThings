For our Father in heaven
Knows all of our needs;
He will care for us always.
We surrender our all,
And make the kingdom of heaven our goal.
#1
God Is Our Father in heaven above,
And He cares for His children with infinite love.
Our worries are needless; look up in the sky
Where carefree and singing the birds freely fly.
Their Maker who knows them,
Supplies all their food;
How much more is our Father
Concerned for our good?
#2
Look at the lilies and see how they grow:
They are clothed by God's goodness in beautiful show.
Our Father in heaven who cares for each flower,
Provides for us always, so great is His power.
The kingdom of heaven
And His righteousness
We will seek with a passion
So all may be blessed.
