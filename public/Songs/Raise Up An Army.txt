Raise up an army, O God,
Awake Your people throughout the earth.
Raise up an army, O God,
To proclaim Your kingdom,
To declare Your word,
To declare Your glory, O God.
#1
Our hope, our heart, our vision,
To see in every land
Your chosen people coming forth.
Fulfilling Your holy mission,
United as we stand,
Pledging our lives unto You, Lord.
#2
O God, our glorious Maker,
We marvel at Your grace,
That You would use us in Your plan.
Rejoicing at Your favour,
Delighting in Your ways,
We'll gladly follow Your command!
