My heart cries out for more of You, Lord;
I'm so hungry for Your presence.
Your love is water to my soul.
I will be satisfied with You, Lord;
You fulfil my deepest longing.
Pour out Your Spirit once again.
#1
Come near to me, as I come near to You;
Pour out Your mercy and Your grace.
I need Your love, I need Your tenderness;
I'm longing for Your sweet embrace.
#2
Draw close to me, as I draw close to You.
Release Your power from above.
I'm dry and thirsty, Lord, come and fill me up;
I'm waiting for Your touch of love.
#3
I've felt Your presence, Lord,
I've tasted of Your love.
Now all I am cries out for more of You,
I want more of You;
More of Your Spirit poured from above,
More of Your power, more of Your love.
