Awesome God, holy God,
I worship You in wonder.
Awesome God, holy God,
As You draw near I'm humbled
By Your majesty, and the mystery
Of Your great love for me.
#1
Your Voice is the voice that
Commanded the universe to be.
Your voice is the voice that
Is speaking words of love to me:
How can it be?
#2
Your arms are the arms that
Hung shining stars in deepest space.
Your arms are the arms that
Surround me in a warm embrace:
Amazing grace.
