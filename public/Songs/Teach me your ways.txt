Purify my heart,
Cleanse me, Lord, I pray,
Remove from me all
That is standing in the way.
Purify my heart,
Cleanse me, Lord, I pray,
Remove from me all
That is standing in the way
Of your love.

Teach me your ways,
O Lord, my God,
And I will walk in your truth.
Give me a totally undivided heart
That I may fear your name.
