It is so good to know,
Lord, you are faithful,
You love without end.
We pledge our heart and soul
To live for the glory of God.
#1
On this day we now come
To stand before the Father,
Enveloped in His love.
Humbly now offering all
To live for the glory of God.
#2
On this day we now come
To kneel before the Saviour,
Jesus Christ the Lord.
With His word in our hearts
We will live for the glory of God.
#3
On this day we now come
Walking in the Spirit û
The holy fire of God.
Anointed with the living flame
We will live for the glory of God.
