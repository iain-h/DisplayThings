May Your kingdom come,
May Your will be done
On earth as it is in heaven;
May Your kingdom come,
May Your will be done
Through me, O Lord, O Lord.
#1
O, that You would bless me,
And enlarge my borders,
That Your hand would be with me,
O Lord, O Lord.
O, that You would keep me,
Keep me from all evil,
So that I may not be ashamed,
O Lord, O Lord.
#2
O, that You would fill me,
Fill me with Your Spirit,
So that I may know Your power,
O Lord, O Lord.
O, that You would use me
To fulfil Your purposes,
That through me Your glory would shine,
O Lord, O Lord.
