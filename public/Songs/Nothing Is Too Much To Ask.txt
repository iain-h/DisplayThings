Nothing Is Too Much To Ask
Now that I have said I'm Yours,
Jesus, take the whole of me
Unreservedly.
#2
Jesus, take me deeper now
That I might go further too,
I've received so much from You
Undeservedly.
#3
I was made to love You, Lord,
I was saved to worship You.
You will be the focus
Of all eternity.
