O Jesus, be glorified
In all of my life.
It's all about You,
And the worship You're due.
So help me to change,
Mould me like clay;
Lord, have Your way,
Lord, have Your way with me.
#1
Teach Me Of Your Ways,
To honour You with all I have,
And that I learn to say:
'Not my will, but Yours, my Lord.'
#2
Lord, I long to be
A faithful child who honours You.
So Jesus, be in me,
Let Your light shine through me now.
