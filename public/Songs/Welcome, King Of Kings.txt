Welcome, King of kings!
How great is Your name.
You come in majesty
Forever to reign.
#1
You rule the nations,
They shake at the sound of Your name.
To You is given all power,
And You shall reign.
#2
Let all creation bow down
At the sound of Your name.
Let every tongue now confess,
The Lord God reigns.
