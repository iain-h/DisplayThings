Hallelujah! hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Hallelu, hallelujah!
#1
Seek ye first the kingdom of God
And His righteousness,
And all these things shall be added unto you,
Hallelu, hallelujah!
#2
You shall not live by bread alone,
But by every word
That proceeds from the mouth of God,
Hallelu, hallelujah!
#3
Ask and it shall be given unto you,
Seek and you shall find.
Knock, and it shall be opened unto you,
Hallelu, hallelujah.
#4
If the Son shall set you free,
You shall be free indeed.
You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free,
Hallelu, hallelujah!
#5
Let your light so shine before men
That they may see your good works
And glorify your Father in heaven,
Hallelu, hallelujah!
#6
Trust in the Lord with all your heart,
He shall direct your paths,
In all your ways acknowledge him,
Hallelu, hallelujah!
