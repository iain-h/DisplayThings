How precious, O Lord,
Is Your unfailing love,
We find refuge in the shadow of Your wings.
We feast, Lord Jesus, on the abundance of Your house
And drink from Your river of delights.
With You is the fountain of life,
In Your light we see light.
With You is the fountain of life,
In Your light we see light.
