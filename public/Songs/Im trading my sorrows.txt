Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes, Lord
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes, Lord
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes, Lord
Amen
#1
I'm trading my sorrows
I'm trading my shame
I'm laying them down for the
Joy of the Lord
#2
I'm trading my sickness
I'm trading my pains
I'm laying them down for the
Joy of the Lord
#B
I'm pressed but not crushed persecuted not abandoned
Struck down but not destroyed
I am blessed beyond the curse
For His promise will endure
That His joy's gonna be my strength.
Though the sorrow may last through the 	night
His joy comes with the morning
