It is no longer I that liveth
But Christ that liveth in me,
It is no longer I that liveth
But Christ that liveth in me.
He lives, He lives,
Jesus is alive in me.
It is no longer I that liveth
But Christ that liveth in me.

The life that I live in the body
I live by faith in the Son.
The life that I live in the body
I live by faith in the Son.
He loves, He loves,
Jesus gave Himself for me.
The life that I live in the body
I live by faith in the Son.
