Sing praise to the name of the Lord most high.
Sing praise to the name of the Lord most high.
Give thanks to the Lord who rescues me,
O righteous God.
#1
O righteous God who searches minds and hearts,
Bring to an end the violence of my foes,
And make the righteous more secure,
O righteous God.
#2
O Lord my God, I take refuge in You;
Save and deliver me from all my foes.
My shield is God the Lord most high,
O Lord my God.
