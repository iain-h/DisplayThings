#1
I lift my voice to praise Your name,
That through my life I might proclaim
The praises of the One who reigns:
Jesus, my Lord.
#2
Like a mighty flame that burns so bright,
I am a bearer of His light.
No longer I, for He is my life:
Jesus, my Lord.
#3
Jesus, Jesus, alive in me.
Jesus, Jesus, setting me free.
