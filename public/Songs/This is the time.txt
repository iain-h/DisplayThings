I hear the sound of a distant thunder,
I hear the sound of a coming rain.
I hear the wind blowing through the harvest,
He's coming, he's coming again.
#1
This is the time,
This is the place;
We're living in a season of amazing grace.
We are the people,
Born for this hour,
And we will be willing in the day of His pow'r.
Can you hear him saying
That the prophecy's fulfilled.
Now a Holy Ghost revival
Is gonna gather every field.
#2
Though the mountains tremble,
Though the oceans roar,
All the earth will be filled
With the glory of the Lord.
