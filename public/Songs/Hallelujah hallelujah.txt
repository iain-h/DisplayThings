Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, the Lord reigns.
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, the Lord Almighty reigns.

He has showed His awesome power,
He has triumphed mightily,
He has triumphed over darkness and the grave.
He has broken chains that bound us,
He has set the prisoner free,
By His own great mercy we are saved.
