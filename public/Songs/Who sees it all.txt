God sees, God knows,
God loves the broken heart;
And holds, and binds,
And heals the broken heart.
#1
Who sees it all, before whose gaze
Is darkest night bright as the day;
Watching as in the secret place
His likeness forms upon a face?
#2
Who sees it all, the debt that's owed
Of lives unlived, of love unknown?
Who weighs the loss of innocence,
Or feels the pain of our offence?
#3
Who knows the fears that drive a choice,
Unburies pain and gives it a voice?
And who can wash a memory,
Or take the sting of death away?
#4
Whose anger burns at what we've done,
Then bears our sin as if His own?
Who will receive us as we are,
Whose arms are wide and waiting now?
#5
Whose broken heart upon a cross
Won freedom, joy and peace for us?
Whose blood redeems, who ever lives
And all because of love forgives?
