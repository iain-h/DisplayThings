(Oh now,) Jesus, Jesus,
I will pour my praise on You.
Worship, worship,
Demonstrates my love for You.
May I come to
Be a blessing to Your heart.
Jesus, Jesus,
Who can tell how wonderful You are,
How wonderful You are!
#1
Lord, Hear The Music Of My Heart;
Hear all the pourings of my soul.
Songs telling of a life of love:
Jesus, this is all for You.
You've become the ruler of my heart;
You've become the lover of my soul.
You've become the Saviour of this life:
You are everything to me.

O, how wonderful You are.
