But may the light
You came to bring now shine
In a world that finally lost its way.
Holy love, now come,
Come flow though me,
Be my theme until my dying day.
#1
Hope of the world,
You stepped into our time,
And yet they spurned You and then turned away.
To a dying world You reached out,
But they didn't want to hear
The words You had to say.
#2
Mercy, love, truth,
You shared all these
And then to bring them life
Became a dying seed.
Now to all who will receive
A new way has been opened,
And Your children are the light they need.
And may the light...
