So with everything we are,
And everything we have
We pour out our offerings.
And if ever we should fail,
The rocks will rise up
And crown Him the King of kings.
#1
Hear All Creation lift its voice,
The mountains sing and the rivers rejoice
For the name of Jesus,
For His name.
And we His people saved by grace,
We bow our hearts and we bring our praise
To the sweet Redeemer,
For His name.
#2
He mends our hearts, He keeps our ways:
He lights our nights and He leads our days,
All for His glory, for His name.
There's nothing greater than to be His,
To bring Him glory and to fully live
For the name of Jesus,
For His name.
