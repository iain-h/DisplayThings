All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,
All things wise and wonderful,
The Lord God made them all.
#1
Each little flow'r that opens,
Each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing colours,
He made their tiny wings.
#2
The purple-headed mountain,
The river running by,
The sunset and the morning,
That brightens up the sky.
#3
The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,
He made them every one.
#4
He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we may tell
How great is God Almighty,
Who has made all things well.
