We will magnify, we will magnify
The Lord enthroned in Zion.
We will magnify, we will magnify
The Lord enthroned in Zion.
#1
O Lord our God, how majestic is your name;
The earth is filled with your glory.
O Lord our God, you are robed in majesty;
You've set your glory above the heavens.
#2
O Lord our God, you have established a throne,
You reign in righteousness and splendour.
O Lord our God, the skies are ringing with your praise;
Soon those on earth will come to worship.
#3
O Lord our God, the world was made at your command,
In you all things now hold together.
Now to him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb
Be praise and glory and pow'r for ever.
