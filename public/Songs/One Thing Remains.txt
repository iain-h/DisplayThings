#C
Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me
#1
Higher than the mountains that I face
Stronger than the power of the grave
Constant through the trial and the change
One thing remains
One thing remains
#2
Because on and on and on and on it goes
It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
And I never ever have to be afraid
Cause one thing remains
One thing remains
#3
In death, in life, I'm confident and covered by the
power of your great love
My debt is paid, there's nothing that can separate my heart
from your great love
