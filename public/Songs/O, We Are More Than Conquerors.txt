O, we are more than conquerors.
O, we are more than conquerors,
And who can separate us from
The love, the love of God?
O yes, we are,
We are more than conquerors.
O, we are more than conquerors.

For He has promised to fulfil His will in us,
He said that He would guide us with His eye;
For He has blessed us with all gifts in Christ,
And we are His delight.

For He's within to finish what's begun in me,
He opens doors that no one can deny;
He makes a way where there's no other way,
And gives me wings to fly.
