#1
Don't let my love grow cold;
I'm calling out, 'light the fire again.'
Don't let my vision die;
I'm calling out, 'light the fire again.'
#2
You know my heart, my deeds;
I'm calling out, 'light the fire again.'
I need Your discipline;
I'm calling out, 'light the fire again.'
#3
I am here to buy gold,
Refined in the fire:
Naked and poor,
Wretched and blind, I come.
Clothe me in white,
So I won't be ashamed:
Lord, light the fire again!
