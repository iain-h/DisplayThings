Praise to Christ our Saviour and our King.
Praise to Christ our King.
#1
Praise To Christ, The Lord Incarnate,
Gift of God by human birth:
He it is who came among us,
Shared our life and showed our worth;
Ours the turmoil He encountered,
Ours the fight He made His own;
Now within our hearts His Spirit
Makes His way of freedom known.
#2
Praise to Christ, the Man of Sorrows,
Tasting death for our release:
His the cup of bitter anguish,
Ours the pardon, ours the peace;
His the blood that seals forgiveness,
Ours the weight of guilt He bore -
So by death and resurrection
Christ has opened heaven's door.
#3
Praise to Christ, the Priest eternal:
Still for us He intercedes;
Still He sees our pains and problems -
How He understands our needs!
Yesterday, today, forever,
Always He remains the same:
Pledged to bring us to the Father,
Strong in grace and free from blame.
