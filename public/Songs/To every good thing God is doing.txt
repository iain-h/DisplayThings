To every good thing God is doing
Within me that I cannot see, amen.
And to the healing virtue of Jesus
That's flowing in me, amen.
For every hope that is still just a dream,
By trusting in you, Lord, becomes reality.
I stake my claim, seal it in faith,
I say amen.

Amen (amen), amen (amen).
So be it, Lord, your word endures, I say 'amen'.
Amen (amen), amen (amen).
So be it, Lord, amen.
So be it, Lord, amen.
