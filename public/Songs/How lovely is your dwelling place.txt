Better is one day in your courts,
Better is one day in your house,
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere.
(Repeat)
#1
How lovely is your dwelling place,
O Lord Almighty.
My soul longs and even faints for you.
For here my heart is satisfied,
Within your presence.
I sing beneath the shadow of your wings.
#2
One thing I ask and I would seek;
To see your beauty:
To find you in the place your glory dwells.
#3
My heart and flesh cry out
For you, the living God.
Your Spirit's water for my soul.
I've tasted and I've seen,
Come once again to me;
I will draw near to you,
I will draw near to you.
