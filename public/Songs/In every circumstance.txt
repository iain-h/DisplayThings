#1
In every circumstance of life
You are with me, glorious Father.
And I have put my trust in you,
That I may know the glorious hope
To which I'm called.
#2
And by the pow'r that works in me,
You've raised me up and set me free;
And now in every circumstance
I'll prove your love without a doubt;
Your joy shall be my strength,
Your joy shall be my strength.
