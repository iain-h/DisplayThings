Great is the Lord;
Sovereign King,
We give You praise.
#1
You spoke Your word and You rescued me,
You poured out Your grace and You set me free.
Now You've filled my life with the Spirit's power,
And You've set my heart on fire.
#2
And by the power of Jesus' name
You have raised me up from my sin and shame.
You've anointed me with the Spirit's power,
And You've set my heart on fire.
#3
By grace I'm saved through faith in God,
Not by works alone but by Jesus' blood.
Now I'm filled with strength by the Spirit's power,
And You've set my heart on fire.
Great is the Lord.
(Repeat)
