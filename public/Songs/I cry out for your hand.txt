For you are good, for you are good,
For you are good to me.
For you are good, for you are good,
For you are good to me.
#1
I cry out for your hand of mercy to healme.
I am weak, I need your love to free me.
Oh, Lord, my rock, my strength in weakness,
Come rescue me, oh, Lord.
#2
You are my hope, your promise never fails me.
And my desire is to follow you for ever.
