Here I am once again,
I pour out my heart for I know that You hear
Every cry; You are listening,
No matter what state my heart is in.
#2
You are faithful to answer
With words that are true
And a hope that is real.
As I feel Your touch,
You bring a freedom to all that's within.

In the safety of this place
I'm longing to...
#4
Pour out my heart, to say that I love You,
Pour out my heart, to say that I need You.
Pour out my heart, to say that I'm thankful,
Pour out my heart, to say that You're wonderful.
