And the creed and the colour
And the name won't matter,
Were you there?
#1
When I Needed A Neighbour,
Were you there, were you there?
When I needed a neighbour, were you there?
#2
I was hungry and thirsty,
Were you there, were you there?
I was hungry and thirsty, were you there?
#3
I was cold, I was naked,
Were you there, were you there?
I was cold, I was naked, were you there?
#4
When I needed a shelter,
Were you there, were you there?
When I needed a shelter, were you there?
#5
When I needed a healer,
Were you there, were you there?
When I needed a healer, were you there?
#6
Wherever you travel,
I'll be there, I'll be there.
Wherever you travel, I'll be there.
