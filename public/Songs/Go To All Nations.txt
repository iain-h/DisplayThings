I am coming soon.
I am coming soon.
I'm waiting at the gates
For the Father's call.
I am coming soon.
Yes, I am coming soon.

Go to all nations, making disciples,
Baptising them in My name.
Go to all nations, making disciples,
Baptising them in My name.
#2
Teach them to do all I told you to do,
Teach them to walk in My ways.
I have authority in heaven and earth,
I will be with you always.
