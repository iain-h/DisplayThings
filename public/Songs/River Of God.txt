River of God, flood over me,
And lift my feet up off the ground.
Carry me out into Your sea,
And in Your presence I'll be found.
#1
I've felt Your fire and I've felt Your rain;
And I've heard Your voice whisper myname.
I've been wading in Your river,
I've ridden on Your waves;
I've tasted of Your goodness,
Still I'm longing to be changed.
#2
There's something inside me that just won't let go;
Why am I afraid of losing control?
Oh, I know Your love is for me,
And You'll never do me harm;
So melt away my fears,
And Holy Spirit come!
#3
I've had enough of holding back,
I see Your goodness all around,
This time I'm opening up my heart,
So come and fill me now.
#4
Please help me, Lord, to be more like You,
To do all the things You've called me to do.
Let me help bring in Your harvest,
Oh, I want it for Your Son;
So fill me with Your power,
Holy Spirit come!
#5
Come like a mighty rushing wind,
A tidal wave or a monsoon rain,
Like a stream in the desert,
Or a warm summer breeze;
Gentle Dove of heaven,
Bring me to my knees!
#6
I've had enough of holding back...
