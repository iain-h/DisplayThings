Consider it joy, pure joy
When troubles come.
Many trials will make you strong.
Consider it joy, pure joy
And stand your ground,
Then at last you'll wear a crown.
#1
Though Trials Will Come,
D zn't fear, don't run.
Lift up your eyes,
Hold fast, be strong.
Have faith, keep on believing.
Lift up your eyes
For God is at work in us,
Moulding and shaping us
Out of His love for us,
Making us more like Jesus.

Though trials will come,
Won't fear, won't run.
We'll lift up our eyes,
Hold fast, be strong.
Have faith, keep on believing.
We'll lift up our eyes
For God is at work in us,
Moulding and shaping us
Out of His love for us,
Making us more like Jesus.
#3
Joy, pure joy,
Consider it joy, pure joy.
Joy, pure joy,
Consider it joy, pure joy.
#4
Patiently trusting Him,
Ready for anything,
Till we're complete in Him,
In everything more like Jesus.
