I bow down at Your feet,
I bow down at Your feet,
I bow down at Your feet
For You are my God, my God.
#1
Around You such beauty,
Your majesty could fill an endless sky:
Holy are You, Lord.
Transcendent, exalted,
The heavens cannot contain Your presence:
Holy are You, Lord.
And as I behold Your glory
I'm undone.
#2
You saved me, the sinner,
With crimson red You washed me white as snow:
How I love You, Lord.
You loved me, the mocker,
With kindness You won my heart forever:
How I love You, Lord.
And as I behold this mercy
I'm undone.
