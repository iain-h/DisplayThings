You are worthy,
You are holy û
The Lord who was,
The Lord who is,
The Lord who is to come;
You are mighty,
You are awesome,
Be praise and honour and glory
For evermore.
#1
Streams of worship
And rivers of praise,
Ascending to the One who is
The Ancient of Days:
To him who is worthy,
To him who was slain,
To him who sits upon the throne
And to the Lamb:
#2
Thousands upon thousands
Encircle the throne,
Singing a new song
To the One who is to come:
To him who is worthy,
To him who was slain,
To him who sits upon the throne
And to the Lamb:
#3
Streams of worship
And rivers of praise
Flowing from the lips of those
Who never cease to be amazed
With him who is worthy,
With him who was slain,
With him who sits upon the throne
And with the Lamb:
#A
