Thine, O Lord, is the greatness,
And the power and the glory.
Thine, O Lord, is the victory,
And majesty, and majesty.
#1
All that is in heaven and earth is thine,
Thou art exalted as head over all!
#2
In Thy hand is power and might to make great,
In Thy hand is power to give strength to all!
#3
Now is come salvation and power and might,
For the kingdom of our God has been given to His Christ!
