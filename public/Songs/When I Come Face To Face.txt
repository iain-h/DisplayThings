#1
When I Come Face To Face
With the One the angels praise,
I'm in awe, I'm amazed
With a God full of grace.
It's the love You have shown
That allows me at Your throne
To adore, and how I do:
Father, I'm in love with You.
#2
Here I am with lifted hands,
I give You praise
And I exalt Your holy name
With all I have,
With all the strength that I can raise.
And here I am once again,
I lift my voice
With all the angels 'round Your throne.
I adore and I worship You alone.
#3
I am in love,
I am in love with all my heart,
With all my soul, and all my mind
With all the strength I've ever known.
I am in love,
I am in love with the King
And with His Son, the One who loved
With His life and with His blood.
