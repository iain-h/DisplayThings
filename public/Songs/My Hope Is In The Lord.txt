My hope is in You, Lord.
My hope is in You, Lord.
My hope is in You, Lord.
My hope is in You, Lord.
#1
My Hope Is In The Lord
Who has renewed my strength,
When everything seems senseless,
My hope is still in Him
Who has made heaven and earth
And things seen and unseen;
Whatever shade of passing day,
My hope is still in Him.
#2
For I know that my eyes shall see You,
In the latter days to come.
When You stand on the earth,
With my lips, I will confess
That the hope of my heart is come,
That the hope of my heart is come.
