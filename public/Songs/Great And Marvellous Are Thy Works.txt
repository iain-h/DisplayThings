#1
Great and marvellous are Thy works,
Lord God Almighty;
Just and true are Thy ways, O Lord,
For You are the King of saints.
#2
Who shall not fear Thee,
Who shall not glorify Thy name, O Lord?
For only Thou art holy.
All the nations shall come and worship before Thee,
For Thy judgements are made manifest.
For Thy judgements are made manifest.
#3
Hallelujah, (hallelujah)
Hallelujah to the King of saints.
Glory hallelujah, (glory hallelujah)
Glory hallelujah to the King of saints.
