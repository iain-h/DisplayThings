God is here
Let the broken hearted rejoice
God is here
Let the sick say I am well
God is here
Let the weak say I am strong
God is here
His wonders to perform
#1
In your presence, there is fullness of life
And healing flowing, for body soul and mind
God of miracles, God of the impossible is here
God is here
#2
In your presence, there is perfect peace
In the stillness, I behold your deity
God of wonders, God of power is here
God is here
