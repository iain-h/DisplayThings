It's a happy day, and I thank God for the weather.
It's a happy day, living it for my Lord.
It's a happy day, things are gonna get better,
Living each day by the promises in God's word.
#2
It's a grumpy day, and I can't stand the weather.
It's a grumpy day, living it for myself.
It's a grumpy day, and things aren't gonna get better
Living each day with my Bible up on my shelf.
