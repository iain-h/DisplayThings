#1
Welcome the King, welcome the King,
Welcome the King, welcome the King,
Welcome the King
Who comes in the name of the Lord.
(Repeat)
#2
Clear the road before him,
Open the ancient doors,
Let every heart receive him:
Welcome the King
Who comes in the name of the Lord.
#3
Who is this King, who is this King,
Who is this King, who is this King,
Who is this King
Who comes in the name of the Lord?
(Repeat)
#4
He is the King of Glory,
Crucified and risen;
He is the Lord Almighty:
Welcome the King
Who comes in the name of the Lord;
Welcome the King
Who comes in the name of the Lord.
