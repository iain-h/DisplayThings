#1
You Are The Fountain Of My Life
And in Your light I find my reason,
'Cause Your love reaches to the stars,
Even the great deep.
And Your love reaches to this heart
And it makes me sing.
#2
Your love reaches me:
It's what I need, it's what I need.
Your love reaches me:
It's what I need, it's what I need.
#3
O Lord, how priceless
Is Your unending love.
Both high and low
Find refuge in Your shadow.
(Repeat)
