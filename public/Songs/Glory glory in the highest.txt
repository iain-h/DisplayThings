Glory, glory in the highest;
Glory to the Almighty;
Glory to the Lamb of God,
And glory to the living Word;
Glory to the Lamb!
(Repeat)

I give glory (glory),
Glory (glory),
Glory, glory to the Lamb!
I give glory (glory),
Glory (glory),
Glory, glory to the Lamb!
I give glory to the Lamb!
