My trust is in the name of the Lord
Who made heaven and earth.

My hope is in the name of the Lord
Who made heaven and earth;
My hope is in the name of the Lord
Who made heaven and earth;

My joy is in the name of the Lord
Who made heaven and earth;
My joy is in the name of the Lord
Who made heaven and earth;
