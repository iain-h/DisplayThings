I worship You, my Lord,
With all my life, praise Your name.
I worship You, worship You, my Lord.
#1
I have found such joy in my salvation
Since I gave my heart to You,
I have found the reason I'm living,
So in love, so near to You.
#2
Oh my Lord, my life I'm giving,
A living sacrifice to You.
Oh my Lord, the reason I'm living
Is to serve and worship You.
