My God shall supply all my needs,
My God shall supply all my needs,
My God shall supply all my needs
'Cause it says so in the Bible,
'Cause it says so (where?)
In the book that came from heaven,
'Cause it says so (where?)
Isaiah fifty-eight eleven.
My God shall supply all my needs
'Cause it says so in the Bible.
