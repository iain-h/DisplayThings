Turn our hearts, change our hearts,
Join our hearts, turn our hearts.
#1
Turn our hearts, turn our hearts.
#2
Turn our hearts to one another,
Let your kindness show:
Where our words or deeds have wounded,
Let forgiveness flow.
#3
Turn our hearts from pride and anger
To your ways of peace,
For you died and shed your blood
That enmity may cease.
#4
Turn the hearts of generations
That we may be one:
Make us partners in the kingdom
Till your work is done.
#5
As we all have been forgiven,
So must we forgive;
As we all have found acceptance,
So let us receive.
#6
Turn our hearts, change our hearts,
Join our hearts, turn our hearts.
