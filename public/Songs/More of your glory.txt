More of your glory,
More of your power,
More of your Spirit in me.
Speak to my heart
And change my life,
Manifest yourself in me.
#1
It's been a long time,
You have stayed on my mind.
There's a stirring in my soul
That causes me to know
How much I need you.
#2
Send your glory
(send your glory),
Send your power
(send your power),
Send your Spirit
(send your Spirit),
Come and change me
(come and change me).
