We shall rise,
We shall meet Him in the air
When He comes again,
And we will worship Him, worship Him,
Give Him praise forever more,
King of kings and Lord of lords.

In majesty He comes,
The Lamb who once was slain;
Riding in majesty, faithful and true,
Eyes ablaze, crowns on His head,
Robe dipped in blood from His suffering,
He is the Word of God,
Coming again, King of kings.
