"Not my own!"
Oh, "not my own!"
Jesus I belong to Thee!
All I have, and all I hope for
Thine for all eternity.
#1
"Not my own!" but saved by Jesus
Who redeem'd me by His blood
Gladly I accept the message,
I belong to Christ the Lord
#2
"Not my own!" to Christ, my Saviour,
I, believing, trust my soul;
Ev'rything to Him committed,
While eternal ages roll.
#3
"Not my own!" my time, my talent,
Freely all to Christ I bring,
To be used in joyful service
For the glory of the King.
#4
"Not my own!" The Lord accepts me,
One among the ransomed throng,
Who in heaven shall see His glory,
And to Jesus Christ belong.
