Only You can fill my deepest longing,
Only You can breathe in me new life;
Only You can fill my heart with laughter,
Only You can answer my heart's cry.
#1
No-one but You, Lord,
Can satisfy the longing in my heart.
Nothing I do, Lord,
Can take the place of drawing near to You.
#2
Father, I love You,
Come satisfy the longing in my heart.
Fill me, overwhelm me,
Until I know Your love deep in my heart.
