We've Come To Praise You,
'Cause You're worthy.
Nobody like You in Your glory.
We love to praise You,
'Cause You're holy, awesome,
Wonderful, mighty God.
#1
And everything that You do
Comes from a heart of love
And a hand of mercy;
For You are faithful and true,
Working all things for good
For those who love You.
#2
For if God in love did not spare His Son,
But He gave Him up for His chosen ones,
How much more will He freely give to us
Who call upon His name? (x4)
