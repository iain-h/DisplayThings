Let me have my way among You,
Do not strive, do not strive.
Let Me have My way among you,
Do not strive, do not strive.
For Mine is the power and the glory
For ever and ever the same.
Let Me have My way among you,
Do not strive, do not strive.

We'll let You have Your way among us,
We'll not strive, we'll not strive.
We'll let You have Your way among us,
We'll not strive, we'll not strive.
For Yours is the power and the glory
For ever and ever the same.
We'll let You have Your way among us,
We'll not strive, we'll not strive.

Let My peace rule within your hearts,
Do not strive, do not strive.
Let My peace rule within your hearts,
Do not strive, do not strive.
For Mine is the power and the glory,
For ever and ever the same.
Let My peace rule within your hearts,
Do not strive, do not strive.

We'll let Your peace rule within our hearts,
We'll not strive, we'll not strive.
We'll let Your peace rule within our hearts,
We'll not strive, we'll not strive.
For Yours is the power and the glory,
For ever and ever the same.
We'll let Your peace rule within our hearts,
We'll not strive, we'll not strive.
