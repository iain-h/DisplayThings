I'm Learning To Love You,
To love and to trust You.
I'm learning to give You all that I am.
I'm learning to cling to the words You have spoken.
I'm learning to let go my life in Your hands.
#2
For You are faithful in all of Your ways,
In wisdom unsearchable, and full of grace.
Oh, You are beautiful beyond words.
I'm learning to love You.
#3
So teach me to love You,
To love and to trust You,
And teach me to give You all that I am.
And teach me to cling to the words You have spoken,
Teach me to let go my life in Your hands.
#4
We are like shadows that change with the day;
And like the flowers our beauty will fade.
But Yours is the kingdom and the power;
Forever and ever Your glory will always remain.
