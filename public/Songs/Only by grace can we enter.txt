Only by grace can we enter,
Only by grace can we stand;
Not by our human endeavour,
But by the blood of the Lamb.
Into your presence you call us,
You call us to come.
Into your presence you draw us,
And now by your grace we come,
Now by your grace we come.
#2
Lord, if you mark our transgressions,
Who would stand?
Thanks to your grace we are cleansed
By the blood of the Lamb.
