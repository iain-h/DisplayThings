Thanks be to God
Who gives us the victory,
Gives us the victory,
Through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Thanks be to God
Who gives us the victory,
Gives us the victory
Through our Lord Jesus Christ.
#1
He is able to keep us from falling,
And to set us free from sin;
So let us each live up to our calling,
And commit our way to Him.
#2
Jesus knows all about our temptations,
He has had to bear them too;
He will show us how to escape them,
If we trust Him He will lead us through.
#3
He has led us from the power of darkness
To the kingdom of His blessed Son.
So let us join in praise together
And rejoice in what the Lord has done.
#4
Praise the Lord for sending Jesus
To the cross of Calvary;
Now He's risen, reigns in power,
And death is swallowed up in victory.
