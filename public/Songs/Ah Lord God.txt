Nothing is too difficult for Thee,
Nothing is too difficult for Thee.
O great and mighty God,
Great in counsel and mighty in deed,
Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing,
Nothing is too difficult for Thee.

Ah Lord God, thou hast made the heavens
And the earth by Thy great power.
Ah Lord God, Thou hast made the heavens
And the earth by Thine outstretched arm.
