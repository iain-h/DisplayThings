It is well (it is well)
With my soul (with my soul),
It is well, it is well with my soul.
#1
When peace like a river
Attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea-billows roll,
Whatever my lot,
Thou hast taught me to know,
It is well, it is well with my soul.
#2
Though Satan should buffet,
Though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ hath regarded
My helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.
#3
For me be it Christ,
Be it Christ, hence to live!
If Jordan above me shall roll,
No pang shall be mine,
For in death as in life,
Thou wilt whisper thy peace to my soul.
#4
But, Lord, 'tis for thee,
For thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, is our goal;
Oh, trump of the angel!
O voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope! Blessed rest of my soul!
