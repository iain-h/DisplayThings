#1
My Heart Is Captivated, Lord, by You alone;
Captured by the awesomeness of You alone.
Melted by the grace and mercy You have shown,
I stand in wonder.
I reach to You,
The One who makes the blind eyes see,
Who breaks the chains of sickness with authority.
Restoring what was broken,
So it may fly again.
#2
I live to worship You;
I breathe to worship You.
All of my days Your face I will seek.
For as I worship You,
You lead me to that place,
To that place of divine exchange.
