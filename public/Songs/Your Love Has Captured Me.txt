#1
Your Love Has Captured Me,
Your grace has set me free;
Your life, the air I breathe:
Be glorified in me.
#2
You set my feet to dancing,
You set my heart on fire,
In the presence of a thousand kings
You are my one desire.
And I stand before You now
With trembling hands lifted high,
Be glorified.
