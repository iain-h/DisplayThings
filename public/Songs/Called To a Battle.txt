By the blood of the Lamb
We shall overcome,
See the accuser thrown down.
By the word of the Lord
We shall overcome,
Raise a victory cry,
Like thunder in the skies,
Thunder in the skies.
#1
Called to a battle, heavenly war;
Though we may struggle, victory is sure.
Death will not triumph, though we may die;
Jesus has promised our eternal life.
#2
Standing together, moving as one;
We are God's army, called to overcome.
We are commissioned, Jesus says go;
In every nation, let His love be known.
