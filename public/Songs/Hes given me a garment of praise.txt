He's given me a garment of praise
Instead of a spirit of despair.
He's given me a garment of praise
Instead of a spirit of despair.
(Repeat)
#1
A crown of beauty,
Instead of ashes.
The oil of gladness,
Instead of mourning.
My soul rejoices
As I delight myself in God.
He's given me a garment of praise
Instead of a spirit of despair
