#1
O Changeless Christ, for ever new,
Who walked our earthly ways,
Still draw our hearts as once You drew
The hearts of other days.
#2
As once You spoke by plain and hill
Or taught by shore and sea,
So be today our Teacher still,
O Christ of Galilee.
#3
As wind and storm their Master heard
And His command fulfilled,
May troubled hearts receive Your word,
The tempest-tossed be stilled.
#4
And as of old to all who prayed
Your healing hand was shown,
So be Your touch upon us laid,
Unseen but not unknown.
#5
In broken bread, in wine outpoured,
Your new and living way
Proclaim to us, O risen Lord,
O Christ of this our day.
#6
O changeless Christ, till life is past
Your blessing still be given;
Then bring us home, to taste at last
The timeless joys of heaven.
