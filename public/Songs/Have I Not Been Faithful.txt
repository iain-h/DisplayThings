I've been waiting for the blessing
For far too long,
I've been waiting for the blessing
For far too long.
#1
Have I Not Been Faithful to You, Lord?
Have I not offered up my prayers
And tried to follow Your word?
Lord, will You search me,
Show me where I'm wrong?
#2
Now Lord, forgive me,
For speaking this right out.
But I see the wicked prosper
While the godly go without.
No, I can't read human hearts,
But do You know where I'm coming from?
#3
Do not be angry with me, O my God,
Please don't hide Your face away.
I'm like a child, and I'm down on my knees
And I'm begging for You
Just to bless me today.
#4
Lord, up ahead You know
I see a lonely road.
Got this burden on my back,
It's such a heavy load.
These days I've questions,
But there's no answers in my songs.
