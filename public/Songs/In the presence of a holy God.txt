#C
And I cry holy, holy, holy God,
How awesome is your name.
Holy, holy, holy God,
How majestic is your name,
And I am changed
In the presence of a holy God.
#1
In the presence of a holy God
There's new meaning now to grace;
You took all my sins upon yourself,
I can only stand amazed.
#2
In the presence of your infinite might,
I'm so small and frail and weak;
When I see your pow'r and wisdom, Lord,
I have no words left to speak.
#3
In the presence of your glory
All my crowns lie in the dust.
You are righteous in your judgements, Lord,
You are faithful, true and just.
#A
