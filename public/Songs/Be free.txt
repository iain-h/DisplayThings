Be free in the love of God,
Let His Spirit flow within you.
Be free in the love of God,
Let it fill your soul.
Be free in the love of God,
Celebrate His name with dancing.
Be free in the love of God;
He has made us whole.
#1
For His purpose he has called us,
In His hands he gently holds us.
He will keep us and sustain us
In the Father's love.
#2
God is gracious, he will lead us
Through His pow'r at work within us.
Spirit, guide us, and unite us
In the Father's love.
