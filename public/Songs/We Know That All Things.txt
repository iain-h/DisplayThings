We are more than conquerors,
We are more than conquerors,
Through Christ, through Christ.
#1
We know that all things work together for our good
For good to those who love the Lord;
For God has called us to be just like His Son,
To live and walk according to His word.
#2
I am persuaded that neither death nor life,
Nor angels, principalities, nor powers,
Nor things that are now, nor things that are to come,
Can separate us from the love of Christ.
#3
If God is for us, who against us can prevail?
No one can bring a charge against His chosen ones;
And there will be no separation from our Lord,
He has justified us through His precious blood.
