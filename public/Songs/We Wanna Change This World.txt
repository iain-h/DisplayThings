We wanna change this world,
We wanna change this world.
WE WANNA CHANGE THIS WORLD,
We wanna change this world.
#1
So wave those flags of justice
Over the nations,
And hit those drums of peace
Among the peoples.
We hear the sound of history in the making,
Let God's love run around the earth
And bring freedom!
#2
So hold each other's hands
Across the oceans,
And play those chords of peace
Among the peoples.
We hear the sound of reconciliation:
Let God's love dance around the earth
And bring freedom!
#3
And we wanna change this world
As we live out holy lives.
And we wanna change this world
As You wash our motives clean.
And we wanna change this world
As we live out holy lives.
And we wanna change this world
As You wash our motives clean.
Oh, wash us clean!
