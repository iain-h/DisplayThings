How Great Are You, Lord,
How great is Your mercy,
How great are the things
That You have done for me.
How great are You, Lord,
Your loving kindness
Is filling my heart as I sing,
How great are You, Lord.
#2
How great is Your love,
It reaches to the heavens;
How great is the heart
That sought and rescued me.
