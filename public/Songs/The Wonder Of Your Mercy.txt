The Wonder Of Your Mercy, Lord,
The beauty of Your grace,
That You would even pardon me
And bring me to this place.
I stand before Your holiness,
I can only stand amazed:
The sinless Saviour died to make
A covenant of grace.
#1
I only want to serve You,
Bring honour to Your name,
And though I've often failed You,
Your faithfulness remains.
I'll glory in my weakness,
That I might know Your strength.
I will live my life at the cross of Christ,
And raise a banner to proclaim:
#2
You welcome us before You,
Into this holy place;
The brilliance of Your glory
Demands our endless praise.
The One, the only Saviour
Has opened heaven's doors;
We can enter in, free from all our sin,
By Your cleansing sacrifice.
