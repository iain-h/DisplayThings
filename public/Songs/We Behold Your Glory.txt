#1
We behold Your glory,
Fountain of life, the Lord Jesus Christ.
Lord of the universe,
You die in weakness;
Strong Deliverer,
How You were wounded.
Sustainer of life,
Disfigured and shamed,
This is the medicine
That saves and heals us.
A crown of thorns
Was placed on Your brow;
Though You were scourged,
Blow after blow,
By Your stripes we are healed.
#2
We behold Your glory,
Fountain of life, the Lord Jesus Christ.
Though You were fettered,
We are delivered;
Though You were condemned,
We are absolved.
Though You were exposed
To mocking and shame,
We are established
And raised up in honour.
Though You were laid
In the dust of death,
Though You went down
To hell's darkest depths,
The kingdom of heaven is ours.
