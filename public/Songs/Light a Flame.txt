#C
Light a flame within my heart
That's burning bright;
Fan the fire of joy in me
To set the world alight.
Let my flame begin to spread,
My life to glow;
God of light may I reflect
Your love to all I know.

From heaven's splendour
He comes to earth,
While all the angels celebrate
The goodness of His birth.
#2
We too exalt You,
Our glorious King;
Jesus our Saviour
Paid the price to take away our sin.
