Lord, you put a tongue in my mouth
And I want to sing to you.
Lord, you put a tongue in my mouth
And I want to sing to you.
Lord, you put a tongue in my mouth
And I want to sing only to you.
Lord Jesus, free us in our praise;
Lord Jesus, free us in our praise.

Lord, you put some hands on my arms
Which I want to raise to you . . .

Lord, you put some feet on my legs
And I want to dance to you . . .
