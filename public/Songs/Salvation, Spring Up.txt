#1
Salvation, Spring Up from the ground,
Lord, rend the heavens and come down.
Seek the lost and heal the lame;
Jesus, bring glory to Your name.
Let all the prodigals run home,
All of creation waits and groans.
Lord, we've heard of Your great fame;
Father, cause all to shout Your name.
#2
Stir up our hearts, O God;
Open our spirits to awe who You are.
Put a cry in us
So deep inside,
That we cannot find
The words we need,
We just weep and cry out to You.
