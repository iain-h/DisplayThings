#1
Almighty God, faithful and true,
In my worship I want to meet with You.
Unchanging God, forever the same,
It's You I worship,
To know Your heart again.
#2
And I fall down on my knees again,
As You show me what grace means;
And You love with such amazing love,
O my God, how can this be?
