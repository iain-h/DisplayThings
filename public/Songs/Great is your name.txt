#C
Only you deserve the glory,
Only you deserve the praise,
Only you deserve the honour,
So great are your ways.
(Repeat)
#1
Great is your name,
Great are your deeds, O Lord.
Day after day
Your mercies displayed to all.
There is none like you,
Who loves the way you do, Jehovah.
#2
Faithful and true
In all you do, O Lord.
Saviour and King,
My everything, my all.
There is none like you,
Who loves the way you do, Jehovah.
