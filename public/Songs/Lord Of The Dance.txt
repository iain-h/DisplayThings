Lord of the dance,
You're the dancing Lord.
(Repeat x4)
Everybody dance, yeah!

Well everybody dance, now,
Get in the Holy Ghost.
Everybody praise the One, love the One,
You want the One, yeah,
The One you want the most, now.
#2
Can't nobody stop me now,
I'm gonna give it everything I've got.
I come to You, run to You,
Run to You, yeah,
Just like a child.
#3
It's just this love I have inside,
Yeah, I want it.
I feel You pleasure in my heart,
Yeah, I need it.
I want Your love
More and more each day.
And when I dance before You, Lord,
I'm gonna dance with all my might.
