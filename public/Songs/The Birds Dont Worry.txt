So don't you worry 'bout the things you need,
For clothes to wear or for food to eat;
But seek His kingdom and the rest will come:
You can depend on Him.
#1
The Birds Don't Worry,
The flowers don't fret,
The trees don't hurry
For the food they get;
For God looks after
The things He's made:
They can depend on Him.
#2
The hills don't grumble,
The stars don't cry,
The sun doesn't tumble
From the big, blue sky;
For God has set everything in place:
They can depend on Him.
