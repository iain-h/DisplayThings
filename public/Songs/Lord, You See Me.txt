Here, where truth and mercy meet,
You triumph over me,
Your love has won my heart again.
And still I am so amazed,
My guilt is washed away
Before Your cross of peace,
Where truth and mercy meet.
#1
Lord, You See Me through Your mercy:
I am guilty, still You love me.
In Your kindness there is justice;
Through Your goodness,
You have brought me
#2
King of glory, Lord of mercy,
Risen Saviour, Perfect Wonder.
Through Your kindness
You have drawn me,
By Your suffering
You have saved me.
