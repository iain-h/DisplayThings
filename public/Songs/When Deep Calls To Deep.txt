Give me oil for my wounds,
Give me wine for my heart,
Give me strength for today,
And I will stand.
Give me salve for my eyes,
Give me truth for the lies,
Give me love in my life
And I will run with You.

When Deep Calls To Deep
There's a stirring inside of me,
A feeling that words won't describe;
Like I'm hearing Your song
Touching my spirit,
Calling me deeper with You.
#2
And the thirst in my soul
Just to meet with You, God,
I'm feeling the pull of Your love;
Like the crash of Your waves,
Like the roar or Your waterfalls,
Drawing me on into You.
#3
And all I know is it's You.
And I cry out to You.
