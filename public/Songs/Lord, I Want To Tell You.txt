Lord, I Want To Tell You
How much I love You;
Your tenderness and mercy
Have overwhelmed my heart.
Let my whole life be
An overflow of worship:
All I have and all I am
I give back, Lord, to You.
#2
Lord, I want to tell You
My heart's desire,
The love You've put within me
Will burn with holy fire.
Let my actions spring
From an overflow of worship:
All I have and all I am
I gladly give back to You.
