Lord, I will call only to You,
For You deserve the highest praise.
And I will live only for You,
For You deserve the highest praise.
#1
My Friend And King,
Love sweeter than a rose;
You meet me where I am.
What can I do
But bow down on my knees?
Your beauty blows my mind.
#2
To be with You
Is all that I desire;
Lord, may You shine in me.
You gave me life
And sacrificed Your own;
Who else would die for me?
