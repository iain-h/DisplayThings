God will make a way
Where there seems to be no way.
He works in ways we cannot see.
He will make a way for me.
He will be my guide,
Hold me closely to His side,
With love and strength for each new day.
He will make a way,
He will make a way.
#1
By a roadway in the wilderness he'll lead me,
And rivers in the desert will I see;
Heaven and earth will fade
But His Word will still remain,
He will do something new today.
