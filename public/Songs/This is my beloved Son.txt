That the Lamb who was slain
Might receive the reward,
Might receive the reward
Of His suffering.
#1
This is my beloved Son
Who tasted death
That you, my child, might live.
See the blood he shed for you,
What suffering,
Say what more could he give?
Clothed in His perfection
Bring praise, a fragrant sweet,
Garlanded with joy,
Come worship at His feet.
#2
Look, the world's great harvest fields
Are ready now
And Christ commands us: 'Go!'
Countless souls are dying
So hopelessly,
His wondrous love unknown.
Lord, give us the nations
For the glory of the King.
Father, send more labourers
The lost to gather in.
#3
Come the day when we will stand
There face to face,
What joy will fill His eyes.
For at last His bride appears
So beautiful,
Her glory fills the skies.
Drawn from every nation,
People, tribe and tongue;
All creation sings,
The wedding has begun.
