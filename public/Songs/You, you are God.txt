You, you are God
You are Lord
You are all I'm living for
You are King
Of everything
I want my life to praise you
#1
Here I am, I've come to find you
Here I am, to see your grace
To bring to you an offering
I have to ask myself one thing:
How can I do anything but praise?
I praise..............
#2
Here I am, I've come to thank you
Here I am, a life you've changed
Because you gave your life for me
You crucified your Son for me
How can I do anything but praise?
I praise..............
