He Is Holy, Holy, Holy,
My Lord is holy, holy, holy, Jesus.
Give glory, glory, glory to the Son,
Glory, glory, glory to Jesus!
#1
We're gonna give Him praise,
And His name we'll raise
As we celebrate with Jesus.
Let our voices sing to the King of kings,
Who was and is to come.
#2
He's the Prince of Peace
And He will release
All the chains that keep you down.
He's the Son of Man,
He's the Great I Am,
He's the mighty Lamb of heaven!
#3
He's the God of grace,
And if we seek His face
He'll demonstrate His power.
On the final day unto the bride He'll say:
'At My side you'll stay forever and ever.'
