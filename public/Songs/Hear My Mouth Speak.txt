Light of the world, would You shine on me?
Light of the world, would You shine on me?
#1
Hear My Mouth Speak, see my mind think,
Know my spirit tries to pray.
Lord, we're longing to see You moving,
Help us as we pray today.
Words don't seem enough to tell You our desire,
To see Your kingdom come and Your light shine.
#2
Now I trust You, and I ask You,
Let Your will be done in me.
May Your light shine in all the earth and
Let it draw us all to You.
Now Your glory shines throughout Your holy church,
'Cause You're our only hope, Saviour of the world.
#3
Shine on me so I reflect Your glory,
Live in me so people see Your beauty,
Pour on me, so out of me flow streams of living water.
(Repeat)
