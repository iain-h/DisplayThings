You are the Hope, living in us,
You are the Rock, in whom we trust.
You are the Light,
Shining for all the world to see.
You rose from the dead, conquering fear,
Our Prince of Peace, drawing us near.
Jesus, our Hope,
Living for all who will receive,
Lord, we believe.
#1
Jesus, Hope Of The Nations;
Jesus, comfort for all who mourn,
You are the source
Of heaven's hope on earth.
#2
Jesus, light in the darkness,
Jesus, truth in each circumstance,
You are the source
Of heaven's light on earth.
#3
In history, You lived and died,
You broke the chains, You rose to life.
