Jesus, Name above all names,
I will ever more proclaim:
'Worthy is the Lamb
To receive all power,
To receive all praise.'
#1
Your Name Is Love,
The love that went to the cross.
Your name is peace,
You've taken my sins away,
And how I love all that You are,
Your name is Jesus.
#2
Your name is truth,
The truth that sets me free.
Your name is hope,
Hope for eternity,
And how I love all that You are,
Your name is Jesus.
#3
Your name is Lord,
I gladly bow the knee.
You are a friend,
A friend of sinners like me,
And how I love all that You are,
Your name is Jesus.
