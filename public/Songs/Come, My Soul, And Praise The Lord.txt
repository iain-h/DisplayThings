Come, my soul, and praise the Lord. (men - women echo)
Sing to Christ, the living Word,  (Men - Women echo)
Who heals my broken heart,  (Men - Women echo)
And binds my wounds. (Men - Women echo)
#1
Holy, Holy is the Lord, (men - women echo)
Who may stand before His word?  (Men - Women echo)
He knows my life so well,  (Men - Women echo)
Yet loves me still. (Men - Women echo)
#2
As His eye is on the sparrow,
So His thoughts are for my life.
Not a moment passes by
But He thinks of me,
And He hears me when I cry.
So come my soul.
