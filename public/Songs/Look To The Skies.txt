Worship the King - come, see His brightness;
Worship the King, His wonders tell:
Jesus our King is born today;
We welcome You, Emmanuel!
#1
Look to the skies, there's a celebration,
Lift up your heads, join the angel song,
For our Creator becomes our Saviour,
As a baby born!
Angels, amazed, bow in adoration:
'Glory to God in the highest heaven!'
Send the good news out to every nation
For our hope has come.
#2
Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God,
Father for ever, the Prince of Peace:
There'll be no end to Your rule of justice,
For it shall increase.
Light of Your face, come to pierce our darkness;
Joy of Your heart come to chase our gloom;
Star of the morning, a new day dawning,
Make our hearts Your home.
#3
Quietly He came as a helpless baby -
One day in power He will come again;
Swift through the skies He will burst with splendour
On the earth to reign.
Jesus, I bow at Your manger lowly:
Now in my life let Your will be done;
Live in my flesh by Your Spirit holy
Till Your kingdom comes.
