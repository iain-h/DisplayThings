In this bread there is healing
In this cup there's life forever
In this moment, by the Spirit
Christ is with us here
#1
Here is bread, here is wine
Christ is with us, He is with us
Break the bread, drink the wine
Christ is with us here.
#2
Here is grace, here is peace
Christ is with us, He is with us
Know His grace, find His peace
Feast on Jesus here
#3
Here we are, joined in one
Christ is with us, He is with us
We'll proclaim, till He comes
Jesus crucified
