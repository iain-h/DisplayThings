#1
I lift my eyes to the quiet hills,
In the press of a busy day;
As green hills stand in a dusty land,
So God is my strength and stay.
#2
I lift my eyes to the quiet hills,
To a calm that is mine to share;
Secure and still in the Father's will,
And kept by the Father's care.
#3
I lift my eyes to the quiet hills,
With a prayer as I turn to sleep;
By day, by night,
Through the dark and light,
My Shepherd will guard His sheep.
#4
I lift my eyes to the quiet hills,
And my heart to the Father's throne;
In all my ways to the end of days,
The Lord will preserve His own.
