I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever,
I will sing, I will sing.
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever,
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord.

With my mouth will I make known
Thy faithfulness, Thy faithfulness.
With my mouth will I make known
Thy faithfulness to all generations.
