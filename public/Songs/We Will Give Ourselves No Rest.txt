We're knocking, knocking on the door of heaven,
We're crying, crying for this generation,
We're praying for your name to be known
In all of the earth.
We're watching, watching on the walls to see you,
We're looking, looking for a time of breakthrough
We're praying for your word to bear fruit
In all of the earth, in all of the Earth
#1
We will give ourselves no rest
'Till your kingdom comes on earth;
You've positioned watchmen on the walls.
Now our prayers will flow like tears,
For you've shared your heart with us;
God of Heaven, on our knees we fall.
Come down, in power,
Reveal your heart again;
Come hear, our cries,
The tears that plead for rain.
