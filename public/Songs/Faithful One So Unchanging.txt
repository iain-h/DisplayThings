#1
Faithful one, so unchanging,
Ageless One, you're my rock of peace.
Lord of all, I depend on You,
I call out to You again and again
I call out to You again and again
#2
You are my rock in times of trouble
You lift me up when I fall down.
All through the storm
Your love is the anchor,
My hope is in You alone.
