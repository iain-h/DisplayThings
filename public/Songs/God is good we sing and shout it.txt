#1
God is good, we sing and shout it,
God is good, we celebrate.
God is good, no more we doubt it,
God is good, we know it's true.
#2
And when I think of His love for me,
My heart fills with praise
And I feel like dancing.
For in His heart there is room for me
And I run with arms opened wide.
