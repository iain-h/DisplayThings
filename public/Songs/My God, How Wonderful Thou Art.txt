My God, how wonderful thou art,
Thy majesty how bright!
How beautiful Thy mercy-seat,
In depths of burning light!
#1
How dread are thine eternal years,
O everlasting Lord,
By prostrate spirits day and night
Incessantly adored!
#2
How wonderful, how beautiful
The sight of Thee must be,
Thine endless wisdom, boundless power,
And awesome purity!
#3
O how I fear Thee, living God,
With deepest, tenderest fears,
And worship Thee with trembling hope
And penitential tears!
#4
Yet I may love Thee too, O Lord,
Almighty as Thou art,
For Thou hast stooped to ask of me
The love of my poor heart.
#5
No earthly father loves like Thee;
No mother e'er so mild
Bears and forbears as Thou hast done
With me, Thy sinful child.
#6
Father of Jesus, love's reward,
What rapture will it be
Prostrate before Thy throne to lie,
And gaze, and gaze on Thee.
