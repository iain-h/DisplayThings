All that we need is found in You;
Oh, all that we need is in You.
All that we need is found in You;
You are our all in all.
You have become our all in all.
#1
You have become for us wisdom;
You have become for us righteousness.
You have become our salvation;
You have become all our holiness.
#2
You have become our provision;
In union with You we have victory.
In You we have died and have risen;
You are our great hope of glory.
