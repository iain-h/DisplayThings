Lift High The Cross, the love of Christ proclaim
Till all the world adore His sacred name!
#1
Come, brethren, follow where our Captain trod,
Our King victorious, Christ the Son of God.
#2
Each new-born soldier of the Crucified
Bears on his brow the seal of Him who died.
#3
This is the sign which Satan's legions fear
And angels veil their faces to revere.
#4
Saved by this cross whereon their Lord was slain,
The sons of Adam their lost home regain.
#5
From north and south, from east and west they raise
In growing unison their song of praise.
#6
O Lord, once lifted on the glorious tree,
As Thou hast promised, draw men unto Thee.
#7
Let every race and every language tell
Of Him who saves our souls from death and hell.
