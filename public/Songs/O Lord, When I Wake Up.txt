Lift high the name of the Lord.
Lift high the name of the Lord.
That many might know,
That many might see my Lord.

O Lord, When I Wake Up in the morning,
Let my mouth be filled with praise for You.
O Lord, when I go out in the evening,
Let my mouth be filled with praise for You.
That all might know, yeah,
And many might see, yeah,
That You're my Lord.
#2
Fill me with a spirit of boldness, O my God,
And come and take all of my shame;
That I might see temptation
Melt before my eyes
And watch the demons flee in Jesus' name,
As we lift high the name.
#3
O Lord, when I'm stressed and feeling tired,
Let my mouth be filled with praise to You.
O Lord, when I'm pressed on every side,
Let my mouth be filled with praise to You.
That all might know, yeah,
And many might see, yeah,
That You are Lord.
