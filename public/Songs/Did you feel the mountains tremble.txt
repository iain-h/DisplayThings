Open up the doors and let the music play;
Let the streets resound with singing.
Songs that bring your hope,
Songs that bring your joy,
Dancers who dance upon injustice.
#1
Did you feel the mountains tremble?
Did you hear the oceans roar,
When the people rose to sing of
Jesus Christ, the risen one?
#2
Did you feel the people tremble?
Did you hear the singers roar,
When the lost began to sing of
Jesus Christ, the saving one?
#3
And we can see that God, you're moving,
A mighty river through the nations.
And young and old will turn to Jesus.
Fling wide, you heavenly gates,
Prepare the way of the risen Lord.
#4
Do you feel the darkness tremble,
When all the saints join in one song,
And all the streams flow as one river,
To wash away our brokenness?
#5
And we can see that God, you're moving,
A time of jubilee is coming,
When young and old will turn to Jesus.
Fling wide, you heavenly gates,
Prepare the way of the risen Lord.
