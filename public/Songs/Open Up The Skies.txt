It's Your kindness, Lord, that leads us to repentance;
Your favour, Lord, is our desire.
It's Your beauty, Lord, that makes us stand in silence,
And Your love, Your love is better than life.
#1
Open Up The Skies of mercy,
Rain down the cleansing flood;
Healing waters rise around us;
Hear our cries, Lord, let 'em rise.
#2
We can feel Your mercy falling;
You are turning our hearts back again.
Hear our praises rise to heaven;
Draw us near, Lord, meet us here.
