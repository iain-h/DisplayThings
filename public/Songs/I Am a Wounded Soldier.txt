I am loved, I am accepted,
By the Saviour of my soul.
I am loved, I am accepted
And my wounds will be made whole.
#1
I am a wounded soldier but I will not leave the fight,
Because the Great Physician is healing me.
So I'm standing in the battle, in the armour of His light,
Because His mighty power is real in me.
