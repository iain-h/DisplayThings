Lord, keep my heart tender,
Reaching with outstretched hands
To Jesus Christ;
Feeling my hardness melt,
Knowing how Jesus felt,
Possessed by love,
Warm Calvary love.

Lord, keep my heart tender,
Reaching with outstretched hands
For healing grace;
Believe the word revealed—
‘By His stripes we are healed'—
Possessed by love,
Whole Calvary love.

Lord, keep my heart tender,
Reaching with outstretched hands
To those in need;
Finding, as tears I weep,
Compassion's well is deep,
Possessed by love,
Fresh Calvary love.
#4
Lord, keep my heart tender,
Reaching with outstretched hands
To God most high;
Worshipping with desire,
My heart consumed by fire,
Possessed by love,
Strong Calvary love.
