You are great, You are great
All sufficient, powerful
Father, Son and Spirit
You are great, so great!
God who needs no other yet
You long to share eternity with us

Glorious, incredible
Above our thoughts, immeasurable
Beyond the far horizons of our dreams
Radiant in majesty
The greatest of all mysteries
We've only touched the shallows of Your deep

I give my heart for a
Moment with my God
