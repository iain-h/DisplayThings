To receive power and wealth,
To receive wisdom and strength.
To receive honour and glory.
To receive glory and praise.

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain,
Who was slain.
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain,
Who was slain.
#2
Now to Him who sits on the throne
And to the Lamb who was slain,
Now be praise and honour and glory,
And power forever,
And power forever.
#3
Worthy of power and wealth,
Worthy of wisdom and strength.
Worthy of honour and glory,
Worthy of glory and praise.
#4
Unto the Lamb be power and wealth,
Unto the Lamb be wisdom and strength.
Unto the Lamb be honour and glory,
Unto the Lamb be glory and praise.
