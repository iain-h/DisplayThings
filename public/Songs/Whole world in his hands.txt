He's got the whole world in his hands
He's got the whole world in his hands
I fear no evil, for you are with me
Strong to deliver, mighty to save
He's got the whole world in his hands
#1
When all around is fading
And nothing seems to last
When each day is filled with sorrow
Still I know with all my heart
#2
When I walk through fire
I will not be burned
When the waves come crashing round me
Still I know with all my heart
