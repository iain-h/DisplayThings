Lord Jesus, here I stand before You,
To worship You, glorify Your name,
I humbly bow the knee before Your majesty,
Give You the glory, give You the praise.
I love You, lay my life before You,
I trust You for my every need;
I lift my hands to You, surrender everything,
You are my Saviour, My Lord and King.
