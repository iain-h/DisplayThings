We are the church invincible,
The flesh and blood of Christ.
We are the Gospel visible,
Our lives the Saviour's light to the world.
#1
We are the hands of God,
Our task to do His will,
To lay our hands upon this world,
And by His Spirit see it healed.
#2
We are the word of God,
And by the things we say
This world will judge the Prince of life
And be drawn in or turn away.
#3
We are the feet of God,
Who walk the narrow way,
And every step we take is watched
By those for whom we fast and pray.
#4
Though persecution comes,
And governments oppose,
Beneath the crushing weight of law
The church of Jesus grows and grows.
