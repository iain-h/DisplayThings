Jesus is Lord! Jesus is Lord!
Praise him with hallelujahs
For Jesus is Lord!
#1
Jesus is Lord! creation's voice proclaims it,
For by His pow'r each tree and flow'r
Was planned and made.
Jesus is Lord! the universe declares it,
Sun, moon and stars in heaven
Cry, 'Jesus is Lord!'
#2
Jesus is Lord! yet from His throne eternal
In flesh he came to die in pain
On Calvary's tree.
Jesus is Lord! from him all life proceeding,
Yet gave His life a ransom
Thus setting us free.
#3
Jesus is Lord! o'er sin the mighty conqueror,
From death he rose, and all His foes
Shall own His name.
Jesus is Lord! God sent His Holy Spirit
To show by works of power
That Jesus is Lord.
