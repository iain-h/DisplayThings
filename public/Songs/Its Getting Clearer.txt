You are my strength, You are my shield,
You are the Rock on which I want to build my life,
O Lord, O Lord.
I won't compromise, I won't be denied,
I want to keep my eyes on the prize
Of knowing You, knowing You.
#1
It's getting clearer, the light is dawning,
I'm pressing on to a higher place.
The past behind me, I'm moving forward,
And I will follow after You.
#2
There is a passion that burns within me,
I long to see Your kingdom come.
To know Your presence, to seek no other;
I hunger, Lord, for more of You.
