There's a river, there's a river,
There's a river flowing from the throne.
There's a river, there's a river
And it flows throughout the world.
There's a river, there's a river,
There's a river flowing from the throne.
There's a river, there's a river
And it's flooding over me.
#1
There's a river flowing from the throne,
Not a gentle stream but powerful flow.
It brings the city of our God such joy
And springs up fountains in her midst.
On the banks the trees are full of life,
The fruit just grows and grows all the year round.
The leaves are green and never seem to die
They're for the healing of this world.

You invited me to come for free,
Enjoy the feast you had prepared for me.
Draw with laughter from your sparkling wells
Bathe in your river of delights.
First you led me to the edge of the stream
Cautiously I put my ankles in.
The thrill was just too much to describe
And I heard You call me deeper still.
