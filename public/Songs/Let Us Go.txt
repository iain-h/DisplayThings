#1
Let us go up to the house of God
With a shout of praise,
With a song of celebration.
We'll ascend the hill of the Lord,
We can stand in the holy place.
#2
We can have clean hands and a pure heart;
His blood can cleanse us from all our unrighteousness.
He has made a way though the cross;
Jesus' blood was shed for us.
We can draw near to our God.
#3
Now His body has been broken,
And the curtain torn in two.
We can enter by a new and living way
Before His throne.
Yes, we can fellowship with Him,
The King of glory, King of kings.
