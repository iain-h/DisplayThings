Holy, holy, holy, Lord our God,
Who was and is and is to come.
Holy, holy, holy, Lord our God,
Who was and is and is to come.
(Last time)
	Amen. Amen.
#1
The angels, Lord, they sing around your throne;
And we will join their song: praise you alone.
(Repeat)
#2
The living creatures, Lord, speak endless praise;
And joining at your throne, we'll sing their sweet refrain.
(Repeat)
#3
The elders, Lord, they fall before your throne;
Our hearts we humbly bow to you alone.
(Repeat)
#A
