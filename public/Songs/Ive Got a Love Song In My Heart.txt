La la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la.
(Repeat)
#1
I've got a love song in my heart,
It is for You, Lord my God.
I've got a love song in my heart,
It is for You, Lord my God.
#2
I've got a passion in my heart...
#3
I've got rejoicing in my heart...
#4
And there is dancing in my heart...
#5
I've never known a love like this...
