It's as high, high as the heavens above,
Such is the depth of Your love
Toward those who fear You.
O Lord, far as the east is from west,
You have removed my transgressions.
You make my life brand new:
Father, I love You.
#1
I stand amazed when I realise
Your love for me is beyond all measure.
Lord, I can't deny
Your love for me is great.
#2
Your love is higher,
High as the heavens.
Your love is deeper,
Deeper than the deepest ocean.
Your love is stronger,
Stronger than the powers of darkness.
Your love is sweeter,
Sweeter than wine.
