This is the sweetest mystery
That you, O Lord, are One in Three;
Majestic, glorious Trinity
Of Father, Spirit, Son.
The heav'nly Father, great 'I Am',
The Son of God, the Son of Man,
And yet within this wondrous plan
The Spirit with us here.
#2
Lord, may this truth become a flame
That burns within our hearts again,
That we may glorify your name
In all we do and say.
And so, dear Lord, we gladly come
To stand before the Three in One,
And worship Father, Spirit, Son;
Accept the praise we bring.
