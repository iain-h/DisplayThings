#1
Jesus, My Passion in life is to know You.
May all other goals bow down to
This journey of loving You more.
Jesus, You've showered Your goodness on me,
Given Your gifts so freely,
But there's one thing I'm longing for.
Hear my heart's cry,
And my prayer for this life.
#2
Above all else, above all else,
Above all else, give me Yourself.
