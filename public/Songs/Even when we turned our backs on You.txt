Jesus thank You for the Cross
For the blood that sets us free
The crimson stain of all our sin
Washed away in Your mercy
#1
Even when we turned our backs on You
In wickedness and lies suppressed Your truth
Even then You showed Your love for us
Giving up Your life upon the Cross
#2
Enemies of God with no excuse
Knowing what was right we turned from You
Given up to sin condemned to die
Even then You chose to give us life
#3
This is love
This is love
This is love
This is love

Every-one of us deserves to die
But You save all who hope in Your great love
Every-one of us deserves to die
But You save all who hope in Your great love
