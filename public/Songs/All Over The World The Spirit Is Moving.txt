All over the world the Spirit is moving,
All over the world as the prophet said it would be;
All over the world there's a mighty revelation
Of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.
#2
All over His church God's Spirit is moving,
All over His church as the prophet said it would be;
All over His church there's a mighty revelation
Of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.
#3
Right here in this place the Spirit is moving,
Right here in this place as the prophet said it would be;
Right here in this place there's a mighty revelation
Of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.
