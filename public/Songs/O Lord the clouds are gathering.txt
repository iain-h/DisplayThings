Have mercy, Lord (have mercy, Lord),
Forgive us, Lord (forgive us, Lord),
Restore us, Lord,
Revive your church again.
Let justice flow (let justice flow)
Like rivers (like rivers)
And righteousness like a never-failing stream.
#1
O Lord, the clouds are gathering,
The fire of judgement burns,
How we have fallen!
O Lord, you stand appalled
To see your laws of love so scorned
And lives so broken.
#2
O Lord, over the nations now,
Where is the dove of peace?
Her wings are broken.
O Lord, while precious children starve,
The tools of war increase;
Their bread is stolen.
#3
O Lord, dark pow'rs are poised to flood
Our streets with hate and fear;
We must awaken!
O Lord, let love reclaim the lives
That sin would sweep away,
And let your kingdom come.
#4
Yet, O Lord, your glorious cross shall tower
Triumphant in this land,
Evil confounding.
Through the fire your suffering church displays
The glories of her Christ:
Praises resounding.
