#C
For the captain of the host is Jesus;
We're following in His footsteps.
No foe can stand against us in the fray.
(Repeat)
#1
For the Lord is marching on,
And His army is ever strong;
And His glory shall be seen upon our land.
Raise the anthem, sing the victor's song;
Praise the Lord for the battle's won.
No weapon formed against us shall stand.
#2
We are marching in Messiah's band,
The keys of victory in His mighty hand;
Let us march on to take our promised land!
For the Lord is marching on,
And His army is ever strong;
And His glory shall be seen upon our land.
