Living under the shadow of His wing
We find security.
Standing in His presence we will bring
Our worship, worship, worship to the King.
#2
Bowed in adoration at His feet
We dwell in harmony.
Voices joined together that repeat,
Worthy, worthy, worthy is the Lamb.
#3
Heart to heart embracing in His love
Reveals His purity.
Soaring in my spirit like a dove,
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord.
