Rock of ages, Jesus is the rock
Rock of Ages, Jesus is the rock
Rock of Ages, Jesus is the rock

There is no rock
There is no God like our God
No other name worthy of all our praise
The rock of Salvation that cannot be moved
He's proven Himself to be faithful and true
There is no rock
There is no God like ours

Rock of Ages, Jesus You're the rock
Rock of Ages, Jesus You're the rock
Rock of Ages, Jesus You're the rock
There is no rock, there is no God like ours
