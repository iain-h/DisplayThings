#1
You are compassionate and gracious,
Patient and abounding in love;
As far as the east is from the west
You took the sins we were guilty of.
And You deal tenderly with us,
And You deal tenderly with us.
#2
And higher than the heavens,
So great is Your love;
Yes, higher than the heavens
Is Your love for us.
