Lord, Your name is wonderful,
At Your name the captives shall go free.
We declare the mighty name of Jesus,
And proclaim Your holy victory.
#1
At Your name the kingdoms fall;
We declare You Lord of all.
At Your name the enemy shall flee,
You are mighty,
You are mighty Lord of all.
Mighty Lord of all.
#2
(Last time)
Mighty Lord of all!
