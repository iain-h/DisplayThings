#1
When you've been broken, broken to pieces,
And your heart begins to faint,
'Cause you don't understand.
And when there is nothing
To rake from the ashes,
And you can't even walk
Onto the fields of praise.
#2
But I bow down and kiss the Son.
Oh, I bow down and kiss the Son.
#3
When the rock falls, falls upon you,
And you get ground to dust,
No music for your pain.
You open the windows,
The windows of heaven,
And then You opened me,
And You crushed me like a rose.
#4
But I bow down and kiss the Son.
Oh, I bow down and kiss the Son.
Oh, I bow down and kiss the Son.
#5
Let the praise of the Lord be in my mouth,
Let the praise of the Lord be in my mouth.
#6
Though You slay me, I will trust You, Lord.
(Repeat x4)
