Unto you Lord I bring my worship
For you are good
Your love overwhelming
Hope of the world
Your grace is extended
Offering life to all who accept it
#1
Amazing love
Laying down your glory
You endured the cross
Instead of us
Sacrificed your own life
Bore the wrath of God
Jesus you have paid the price for me
Made a way to set this sinner free
#2
Amazing grace
No way I could earn it
It's only by your blood
That I can come
Trusting in your mercy
I'm at peace with God
Jesus you have won the victory
Death has lost it's power over me
