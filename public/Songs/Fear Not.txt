Fear not, for I am with You,
Fear not, for I am with you,
Fear not, for I am with you,
Says the Lord.
(Repeat)
#2
I have redeemed you,
I've called you by name;
Child, you are Mine.
When you walk through the waters,
I will be there,
And through the flame.
You'll not be drowned,
You'll not be burned,
For I am with you.
