Hallelujah, Jesus,
Hallelujah, hallelu.
Hallelujah, Jesus,
Pouring out my heart to You.
#1
With The Choir Of Angels Singing,
And the realm of heavenly hosts;
As those elders humbly bow,
I'd love to come to Your throne
With a simple song.
#2
With the living creatures speaking
Praise and praise and praise again;
With the company of heaven,
I'd love to come to Your throne
With a song of love.
#3
I would bring this praise like incense
Rising to Your throne above,
Fill the air with heart-filled songs
In harmony and melody
To the One I love.
#4
And who can tell the adoration
That will rise up to Your throne?
Every knee that day shall bow
To the King of kings,
The Holy One, the only One.
We'll all be singing...
#A
