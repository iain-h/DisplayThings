A faithful Saviour and unending in mercy
Is our God, the only true God.
The suffering Servant,
And our conquering Hero
Are You, God, forever true God.
You are worthy to receive our lives.
(Last time)
Cleansed from sin and alive to Christ.
#1
If We Died With Christ,
We'll also live with Him,
And if we endure,
We'll also reign with Christ.
If we deny Him, He will disown us,
But if we're faithless,
Faithful He remains.
#2
If we please the Lord
In this present world,
We will inherit eternal life to come.
For He has promised
To raise us from the dead
If we walk worthily of Christ the risen One.
