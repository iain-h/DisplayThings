#1
Lord, we give You praise;
Our prayer of thanks to You we bring.
We sing our songs to You,
For praise belongs to You;
Lord, we give You praise.
#2
Your love goes on and on;
You never change, You never turn.
Our hands we raise to You,
And bring our praise to You;
Lord, we give You praise.
