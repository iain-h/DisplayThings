#1
I am a new creation,
No more in condemnation,
Here in the grace of God I stand.
My heart is overflowing,
My love just keeps on growing,
Here in the grace of God I stand.
#2
And I will praise you, Lord,
Yes, I will praise you, Lord,
And I will sing of all that you have done.
#3
A joy that knows no limit,
A lightness in my spirit,
Here in the grace of God I stand.
