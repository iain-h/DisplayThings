Father God I know that you love me
Father God you gave up your son to save me
Father God help me to be faithful
Father God in everything I do
#2
Help me Lord to love you more
More than I have loved before
Stir your hope within my heart
Show me how I can play my part
I need to feel your warm embrace
To feel your touch upon my face
Help me Lord to fall in love with you all over again
