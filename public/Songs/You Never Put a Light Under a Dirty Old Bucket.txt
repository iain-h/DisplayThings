You never put a light under a dirty old bucket.
You never put a light under a dirty old bucket.
You never put a light under a dirty old bucket
If you want light to shine around, round, round.

Shine, shine around, round round.
Shine, shine around, round, round.
Shine a light that everyone can see.
Lord, help me let my little light shine,
Not just Sundays, all the time,
So friends give praise to You
When they see me.
