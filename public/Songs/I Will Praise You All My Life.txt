O faithful God, O faithful God,
You lift me up and You uphold my cause;
You give me life, You dry my eyes,
You're always near, You're a faithful God.
#1
I will praise You all my life;
I will sing to You with my whole heart.
I will trust in You, my hope and my help,
My Maker and my faithful God.
