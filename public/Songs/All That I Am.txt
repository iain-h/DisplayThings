All that I am I lay before You;
All I possess, Lord, I confess
Is nothing without You.
Saviour and King, I now enthrone You;
Take my life, my living sacrifice to You.
#1
Lord, be the strength within my weakness;
Be the supply in every need,
That I may prove Your promises to me,
Faithful and true in word and deed.
#2
Into Your hands I place the future;
The past is nailed to Calvary,
That I may live in resurrection power,
No longer I but Christ in me.
