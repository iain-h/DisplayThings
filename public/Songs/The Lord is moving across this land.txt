We are marching out to take the land,
Strongholds fall beneath our feet.
Satan, we proclaim your time's at hand;
We're marching on to victory.
#1
The Lord is moving across this land,
It's time to rise up and take our stand
Behind the banner of Jesus Christ
And claim the victory that's ours by right;
We're in God's army,
We're in God's army.
#2
The Spirit's leading us out to war,
But we're not the same as we were before,
We are anointed to multiply;
The Lord has called us and that is why
We're in God's army,
We're in God's army.
#3
The Devil's shakin', His time has come,
The powers of darkness are on the run;
We're standing firm by faith in our authority,
Defeating all our foes and bringing liberty;
We're in God's army,
We're in God's army.
