#C
They that wait on the Lord
Will renew their strength.
Run and not grow weary,
Walk and not faint.
(Repeat)
#1
Do you not know, have you not heard?
My Father does not grow weary.
He'll give passion to a willing heart.
Even the youths get tired and faint,
But strength will come for those who wait.
#2
I will wait, I will wait,
I will wait on you.
I will run, I will run,
I will run with you.
My love, my love,
My love for you.
