#C
Fall like fire, soak like rain,
Flow like mighty waters again and again:
Sweep away the darkness,
Burn away the chaff
And let a flame burn
To glorify your name.
#1
I will never be the same again,
I can never return,
I've closed the door.
I will walk the path,
I'll run the race
And I will never be the same again.
#2
There are higher heights,
There are deeper seas:
Whatever you need to do,
Lord, do in me;
The glory of God fills my life
And I will never be the same again,
And I will never be the same again.
