I am Yours, Lord, I am Yours,
Completely abandoned to You.
I am Yours, Lord, I am Yours,
Wholly devoted to You.
#1
O Lord, You Are First In My Life;
For You I live as a sacrifice,
Holy in Your sight, pleasing to Your heart,
As I put my trust in You.
#2
Precious Jesus, You paid such a cost,
That I may know Your love,
Your grace, Your touch;
With everything I am,
I want to know You more,
My heart is open to You.
#3
As I seek You, Lord,
You draw me nearer.
