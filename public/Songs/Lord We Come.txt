And join our hearts together in love, (men)
Join our hearts together in love, (women)
Join our hearts together in love, (men)
Join our hearts, (women)
And come like the dew on the mountains descending. (all)
Join our hearts together in love, (men)
Join our hearts together in love, (women)
Join our hearts together in love, (men)
Join our hearts, (women)
For there the Lord has commanded the blessing. (all)

Lord we come in Your name,
Gathered here to worship You.
Join us all in harmony,
Spirit, come.

O how good, how beautiful
When we live in unity; (women)
Flowing like anointing oil
On Jesus' head. (men)
#3
So let us all agree
To make strong our bonds of peace.
Here is life forever more,
Spirit, come.
