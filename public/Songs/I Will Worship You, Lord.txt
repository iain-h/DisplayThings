I will worship You, Lord, with all of my might,
I will praise You with a psalm.
I will worship You, Lord, with all of my might,
I will praise You all day long.
#2
For Thou, O Lord, art glorious,
And Thy name is greatly to be praised;
May my heart be pure and holy in Thy sight,
As I worship You with all of my might.
