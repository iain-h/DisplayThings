#1
Come, see the Lord in His breathtaking splendour:
Gaze at His majesty - bow and adore!
Enter His presence with wonder and worship -
He is the King and enthroned evermore.
#2
He is the Word who was sent by the Father,
Born as a baby, a child of our race:
God here among us, revealed as a servant,
Walking the pathway of truth and of grace.
#3
He is the Lamb who was slain to redeem us -
There at the cross His appearance was marred;
Though He emerged from the grave as the victor,
Still from the nails and the spear He is scarred.
#4
He is the Lord who ascended in triumph -
Ever the sound of His praises shall ring!
Hail Him the First and the Last, the Almighty:
Jesus, our Prophet, our Priest and our King.
#5
Come, see the Lord in His breathtaking splendour:
Gaze at His majesty - bow and adore!
Come and acknowledge Him Saviour and Sovereign:
Jesus our King is enthroned evermore.
