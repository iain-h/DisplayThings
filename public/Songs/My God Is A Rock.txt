And in Him I live, for He lives in me.
And in Him I move, and I have my being.
I'm held forever in Your hand
(Rock solid, rock solid).
And now this ground on which I stand
(Is rock solid, it's rock solid).
#1
My God Is A Rock! My feet are planted
And I'm not gonna stop praising.
This love is alive!
Goodness and mercy all the days of my life.
#2
My God is a Rock who can't be shaken,
No, I won't ever stop praising.
This love is alive
With every promise written over my life.
#3
My God is a Rock and my salvation,
That's why I'll never stop praising.
This love is alive!
My strength and shelter all the days of my life.
#4
My God is a Rock who never changes,
How can I ever stop praising?
This love is alive!
Night and day He's watching over my life.
