I worship You,
I worship You,
Lord, I worship You,
Yes, I worship You.
#1
Jesus, You Are So Precious to me;
To behold You is all I desire.
Seated in glory, now and forever,
My Jesus, my Saviour, my Lord.
#2
Jesus, You are so precious to me;
Your beauty has captured my gaze.
Now I will come and bow down before You,
And pour sweet perfume on Your feet.
