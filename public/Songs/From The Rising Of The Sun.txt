From The Rising Of The Sun,
Even to its going down,
Shall Your name be great.
Through all the earth,
Among the nations, we give You praise;
Your name is high above
All other gods.
#1
Jesus, Lover of my soul,
You alone are King, worthy of my praise.
My worship I'll give to only One;
O Lord, my heart I'll bring
When to You I come.
#2
Holiness, Majesty and King,
Let Your will be done
When we worship bring.
Eternal, Your love will remain;
Before Your throne we bow,
With our voices sing.
