Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah to the King.
(Repeat)
#1
You Are My Foundation,
You are my salvation,
A very present help in times of need.
You are my protection,
You are my resurrection,
A higher place is where You're taking me.
#2
I get lifted up on eagles' wings,
You lift me up and so I sing:
#3
You are my Redeemer,
You are my Healer,
A promise given, one of liberty.
You are my Restorer,
You are my strong tower,
The joy of the Lord will be my strength.
