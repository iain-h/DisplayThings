Take, eat, this is my body,
Broken for you,
For I am come that you might have life;
Eat of My flesh and live,
Eat of My flesh and live.
#1
My blood was shed for many,
Taking away your sin,
And if I shall make you free
Then you shall be free indeed,
You shall be free indeed.
#2
Though your sins be as scarlet
They shall be white as snow,
Though they be red like crimson
They shall be as wool,
They shall be as wool.
#3
For God so loved the world
He gave His only Son,
That whosoever believeth on Him
Might have everlasting life,
Might have everlasting life.
