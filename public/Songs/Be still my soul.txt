#1
Be still, my soul:
The Lord is on your side;
Bear patiently the cross
Of grief and pain;
Leave to your God
To order and provide;
In every change
He faithful will remain.
Be still, my soul:
Your best, your heav'nly friend,
Through thorny ways,
Leads to a joyful end.
#2
Be still, my soul:
Your God will undertake
To guide the future
As he has the past.
Your hope, your confidence
Let nothing shake,
All now mysterious
Shall be clear at last.
Be still, my soul:
The tempests still obey
His voice, who ruled them
Once on Galilee.
#3
Be still, my soul:
The hour is hastening on
When we shall be
For ever with the Lord,
When disappointment,
Grief and fear are gone,
Sorrow forgotten,
Love's pure joy restored.
Be still, my soul:
When change and tears are past,
All safe and blessﬁd
We shall meet at last.
