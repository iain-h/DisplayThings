#1
May The Mind Of Christ My Saviour
Live in me from day to day,
By His love and power controlling
All I do and say.
#2
May the word  of God dwell richly
In my heart from hour to hour,
So that all may see I triumph
Only through His power.
#3
May the peace of God my Father
Rule my life in everything,
That I may be calm to comfort
Sick and sorrowing.
#4
May the love of Jesus fill me,
As the waters fill the sea;
Him exalting, self abasing,
This is victory.
#5
May I run the race before me,
Strong and brave to face the foe,
Looking only unto Jesus,
As I onward go.
