The God of abraham praise,
Who reigns enthroned above,
Ancient of everlasting days, and God of love.
Jehovah! Great I AM!
By earth and heaven confessed;
I bow and bless the sacred name forever blessed.
The God of Abraham praise,
At whose supreme command
From earth I rise, and seek the joys at His right hand.
I all on earth forsake-
Its wisdom, fame, and power-
And Him my only portion make, my shield and tower.
#2
The God of Abraham praise,
Whose all-sufficient grace
Shall guide me all my happy days in all my ways.
He calls a worm His friend,
He calls Himself my God;
And He shall save me to the end through Jesu's blood.
He by Himself hath sworn,
I on His oath depend:
I shall, on eagles' wings upborne, to heaven ascend;
I shall behold His face,
I shall His power adore,
And sing the wonders of His grace forever more.
#3
There dwells the Lord our King,
The Lord our Righteousness,
Triumphant o'er the world and sin, the Prince of Peace;
On Zion's sacred height
His kingdom still maintains,
And glorious with His saints in light forever reigns.
The God who reigns on high
The great archangels sing;
And, holy, holy, holy, cry, Almighty King.
Who was and is the same,
And ever more shall be;
Jehovah, Father, Great I AM, we worship Thee.
#4
Before the Saviour's face
The ransomed nations bow;
O'erwhelmed at His almighty grace, forever new:
He shows His prints of love,
They kindle to a flame,
And sound through all the worlds above the slaughtered Lamb.
The whole triumphant host
Give thanks to God on high;
Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost! They ever cry.
Hail, Abraham's God, and mine!
I join the heavenly lays;
All might and majesty are Thine, and endless praise.
