You are God, you are great,
You are Lord over all.
You are good, you are kind,
You are Lord over all.
You are God, you are great,
You are Lord over all.
You are good, you are kind,
You are Lord over all.
My God, my Friend, my King.
#1
Nothing can compare with all your mighty ways.
You sustain the heavens and the earth.
You've revealed your glory
To the sons of men through Jesus.
#2
You're the God of wisdom and of majesty,
The earth is like a footstool at your feet,
Yet you came down and dwelt
Among the sons of men in Jesus.
