Blessed be the name of the Lord, Blessed be Your name.
Blessed be the name of the Lord, Blessed be Your glorious name.
#1
Blessed be your name
In the land that is plentiful,
Where Your streams of abundance flow,
Blessed be Your name.
#2
And blessed be Your name
When I'm found in the desert place,
Though I walk through the wilderness,
Blessed be Your name.
#3
Blessed be Your name
When the sun's shining down on me,
When the world's 'all as it should be',
Blessed be Your name.
#4
And blessbe Your name
On the road marked with suffering,
Though there's pain in the offering,
Blessbe Your name.

You give and take away,
You give and take away.
My heart will choose to say:
Lord, blessed be Your name.
