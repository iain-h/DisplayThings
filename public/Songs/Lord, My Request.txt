Lord, My Request,
Lord, my desire
Is to touch Your very heart
Through the way I live my life.
Jesus, all I seek,
Saviour, all I want
Is a passion for Your ways
And a heart that longs for You,
Yes, a heart that longs for You.
#2
It's the way You walk with me,
It's the way You talk with me,
And You sacrificed Your all to give me life.
It's the way You took that cross
With Your arms held out in love,
Yes, You sacrificed Your all to give me life.
#3
You gave Your all to give me life. (x4)
