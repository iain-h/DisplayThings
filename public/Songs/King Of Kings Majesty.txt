Your majesty, I can but bow
I lay my all before you now
In royal robes I don't deserve
I live to serve your majesty
#1
King Of Kings, majesty
God of Heaven living in me
Gentle Saviour, closest friend
Strong deliverer, beginning and end
All within me falls at your throne
#2
Earth and heaven worship you
Love eternal, faithful and true
Who bought the nations, ransomed souls
Brought this sinner near to your throne
All within me cries out in praise
