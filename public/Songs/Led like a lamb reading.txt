The greatest leader the world has ever known allowed others to lead Him up the blood-soaked pathway to a cross. To those who stood and watched His stumbling to the gallows, He looked like any other condemned prisoner. His destiny no longer His own, a plaything for menacing soldiers. He was a pathetic victim, utterly at the mercy of His Roman masters. A lamb surrounded by lions.

But look again: a crown awaits Him at the top of the hill; a mocking bouquet, perhaps, formed of thorns, but one that hints that a king is present.

He is no helpless victim. His trek to the cross is made freely, a willing offering made by one who lays down His life by choice. Whips and vile abuse don't drive Him up that hill: passion for an orphan world causes Him to climb each step towards even greater agony. It takes more than ropes or nails to pin Him to the wooden crossbars: love is the real shackle that holds Him there. The great leader is led - by love; the truest, purest model of what any leader should be.

He dies, and a curtain in the Temple is ripped from top to bottom; the conflict between heaven and earth settled by His great work. Now the impossible distance created by sin has been closed, and as the tomb is found empty, the great news is confirmed: we are welcome in the Father's house. The war is over. It is finished.
