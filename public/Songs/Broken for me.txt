#C
Broken for me, broken for you,
The body of Jesus, broken for you.
#1
He offered His body, he poured out His soul;
Jesus was broken, that we might be whole.
#2
Come to my table and with me dine;
Eat of my bread and drink of my wine.
#3
This is my body given for you;
Eat it remembering I died for you.
#4
This is my blood I shed for you,
For your forgiveness, making you new.
