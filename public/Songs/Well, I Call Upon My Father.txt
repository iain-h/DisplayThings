I give my love to my Creator,
Reveal my heart unto my God.
I bring my life before the Healer,
For I know in You my shame
Will be thrown down.
#1
Well, I Call Upon My Father
In the name of Christ Your Son,
Let the streams of Your forgiveness
Come upon me as a flood.
#2
For with sin there's separation,
Yet by grace through faith I'm saved;
Can You hear my spirit crying,
'Come and wash my sin away'?
#3
You're washing me down,
You're washing me down.
(Repeat)
#4
Well I call upon my Father
In the name of Christ Your Son,
Now I've tasted Your forgiveness,
My redemption through Your blood.
