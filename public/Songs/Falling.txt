#1
Falling, moving closer,
Deep into You.
Feasting, drinking my fill,
Tasting of You.
#2
Waiting, listening, hoping
Here's where You are.
Craving, calling Your name,
I need You more.
#3
I will hold on,
Hold through the fire,
Cling through the rain,
I long to hear You.
I need You here,
All that You are,
Only Your touch
Will satisfy me.
