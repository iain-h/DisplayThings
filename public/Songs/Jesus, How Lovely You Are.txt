Jesus, how lovely You are,
You are so gentle, so pure and kind.
You shine as the morning star,
Jesus, how lovely You are.
#1
Hallelujah, Jesus is my Lord and King;
Hallelujah, Jesus is my everything.
#2
Hallelujah, Jesus died and rose again;
Hallelujah, Jesus forgave all my sin.
#3
Hallelujah, Jesus is meek and lowly;
Hallelujah, Jesus is pure and holy.
#4
Hallelujah, Jesus is the Bridegroom;
Hallelujah, Jesus will take His Bride soon.
