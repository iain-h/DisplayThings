#1
How can I be free from sin?
Lead me to the cross of Jesus.
From the guilt, the power, the pain?
Lead me to the cross of Jesus.
There's no other way,
No price that I could pay;
Simply to the cross I cling.
This is all I need,
This is all I plead,
That His blood was shed for me.
#2
How can I know peace within?
Lead me to the cross of Jesus.
Sing a song of joy again!
Lead me to the cross of Jesus.
Flowing from above,
All-forgiving love
From the Father's heart to me!
What a gift of grace -
His own righteousness
Clothing me in purity!
#3
How can I live day by day?
Lead me to the cross of Jesus.
Following His narrow way?
Lead me to the cross of Jesus.
