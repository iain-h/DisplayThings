#C
Yours Is The Kingdom,
The power and the glory,
Forever and ever,
Forever and ever, Amen!
(Repeat)
#1
A trumpet blast will herald
The day of Your return:
Your glory and Your splendour
Will be seen in all the earth!
#2
And oh, what a day,
Oh, what a day that will be,
When the earth joins with heaven
In worship and praise to Jesus!
#3
The time is drawing nearer,
I believe it's coming soon,
When we will rise to greet You
As a bride to meet her groom.
