I give You all my love, I give You everything.
You are God of heaven, and head over heels with me!
I know You burn with passion, when I call on Your name,
Your love runs as a river, washing my shame away,
Restoring my faith again, yeah.
#1
Lord, When I Think Of You,
And what I put You through,
I'll never understand Your endless mercy.
To think You chose to come,
Embodied in Your Son
To fall into the hands of Your created.
Oh, feel my heart explode with praise, yeah.
#2
How did You look upon
The sight of Your own blood?
You even took the sin of those who nailed You!
For grace and justice meet
In Him who's chosen me
To walk a path that takes me on to heaven.
Oh, feel my heart explode with praise, yeah.
