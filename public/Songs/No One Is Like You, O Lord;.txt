None like You, O Lord,
The King and the Creator.
None like You, O Lord,
Our Father and our Maker.
None like You, O Lord,
Your faithfulness surrounds You.
How majestic is Your name,
As Your people we proclaim:
#1
No one is like You, O Lord;
You are great and Your name is mighty.
No one is like You, O Lord;
You are great and Your name is mighty.
Who should not revere You,
O King of the nations?
Who should not revere You,
For this is Your due?
Among all wise men
In all of their kingdoms,
There is none like You.
#2
No one is like You, O Lord;
You're enthroned over all the nations.
No one is like You, O Lord;
You're enthroned over all the nations.
Who should not revere You,
O King of the nations?
Who should not revere You,
For this is Your due?
Among all the wise men
In all of their kingdoms,
There is none like You.
