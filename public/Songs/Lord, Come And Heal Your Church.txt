We will draw near,
And surrender our fear;
Lift our hands to proclaim
Holy Father, You are here.
#1
Lord, come and heal Your church,
Take our lives and cleanse with Your fire.
Let Your deliverance flow,
As we lift Your name up higher.
#2
Spirit of God, come in
And release our hearts to praise You.
Make us whole, for
Holy we'll become, and serve You.
#3
Show us Your power, we pray,
That we might share in Your glory.
We shall arise and go
To proclaim Your works most holy.
