King Of Love, praise You,
King of love, worship You,
King of love, thank You,
I'm treasure in Your eyes.
#1
I know my heart will love You forever,
I know Your word, I'll always be Your child.
I know my soul is safe for eternity
'Cause You hold me close in Your arms.
#2
Gonna give You all the praise I can,
Gonna give You all the thanks I can.
In Your arms I will be, King of love, holding me.
Gonna give You all the love I can,
Gonna give You all the praise I can.
King of love, King of love, I worship You.
