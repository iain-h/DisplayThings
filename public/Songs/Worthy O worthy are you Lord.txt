Worthy, O worthy are you, Lord,
Worthy to be thanked and praised
And worshipped and adored.
Worthy, O worthy are you, Lord,
Worthy to be thanked and praised
And worshipped and adored.

Singing hallelujah,
Lamb upon the throne,
We worship and adore you,
Make your glory known.
Hallelujah, glory to the King:
You're more than a conqueror,
You're Lord of everything.
