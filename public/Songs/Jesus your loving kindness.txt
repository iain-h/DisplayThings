Your love is better than life,
I know it well
And I'll find all that I need in you, in you.
Your love is better than life,
I know it well
And I'll find all that I need in you.

Jesus, your loving kindness,
I'm so blessed by all that you've done,
This life that you give.
Jesus, your loving kindness
Is life that's changing my heart,
Drawing me near to you.
