Release Your power among us, Lord,
That all may see Your glory.
(Repeat)
#1
Lord, I give my life to You,
And trust Your holy name;
Help me grow in holiness,
And follow You in all Your ways.
Send Your Holy Spirit,
That I may truly be
Cleansed within my heart
And free from all impurity.
#2
O Lord, as we come trusting our way to You,
Make our righteousness shine like the dawn.
#3
Teach me, Lord, to listen
To the calling of Your Spirit,
Helping me and guiding me
To live my life as Jesus did.
I long to know Your power
And see the sick get healed;
Come and move among us, Lord,
That truth will be revealed.
