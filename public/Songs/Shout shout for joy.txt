Shout, shout for joy,
Shout, shout for joy,
For the Lord has given you the victory.
Shout, shout for joy,
Shout, shout for joy,
For the Lord has given you the victory.

No weapon formed against you shall prosper.
No kingdom raised against you shall stand.
For the Lord is the rock of our salvation,
And we have overcome by the blood of the Lamb.
