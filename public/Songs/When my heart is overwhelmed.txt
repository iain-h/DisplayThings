And lead me to the rock,
The rock that's higher,
Lead me to the rock
That's higher than I.
Lead me to the rock
The rock that's higher, higher than I.
(Repeat)
#1
When my heart is overwhelmed,
Hear my cry, give heed to my prayer;
And my eyes are dim with tears,
O Father, make them clear;
From the ends of all the earth,
When my heart is fainting,
Let me know that you have heard,
Lead me into safety.
#2
You, O Lord, have been for me
A refuge from my enemies,
Let me live within your strength,
In the shelter of your wings;
From the ends of all the earth,
When my heart is fainting,
Let me know that you have heard,
Lead me into safety.
