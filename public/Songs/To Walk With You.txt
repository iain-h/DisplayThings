To be Your joy, to give You glory;
To live with You, forever with me.
To love You, Lord, as You have loved me,
Is all I ask of You,
All I ask of You.
#1
To Walk With You, to know You near me,
To know Your voice, to hear You call me;
This is all I ask of You.
To be Your son, to feel You hold me,
To know Your grace, to know You love me;
This is all I ask of You,
This is all I ask of You.
#2
To love Your ways, to see Your beauty,
To seek Your face with all that's in me;
This is all I ask of You.
To worship You, to be Yours only,
To cry Your name, my Lord Almighty;
This is all I ask of You,
This is all I ask of You.
#3
To live Your life, to serve You justly,
To tell Your word, to show Your mercy;
This is all I ask of You.
To bring Your light to those who know me,
To be like You, as You are holy;
This is all I ask of You,
This is all I ask of You.
