I will arise and give thanks to you,
Lord, my God,
And your name I will bless
With my whole heart.
You have shown mercy,
You have shown mercy to me.
I give thanks to you, Lord.
#1
You have shown me favour unending;
You have given your life for me.
And my heart knows of your goodness,
Your blood has covered me.
#2
You have poured out your healing upon us;
You have set the captives free.
And we know it's not what we've done,
But by your hand alone.
#3
You, O Lord, are the healer of my soul.
You, O Lord, are the gracious Redeemer,
You come to restore us again.
Yes, you come to restore us again, and again.
#B
We will arise and give thanks to you,
Lord, our God,
And your name we will bless
With all our hearts.
You have shown mercy,
You have shown mercy to us.
We give thanks to you, Lord.
