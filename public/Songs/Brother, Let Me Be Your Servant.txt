#1
Brother, let me be Your servant,
Let me be as Christ to you;
Pray that I may have the grace
To let you be my servant, too.
#2
We are pilgrims on a journey,
We are brothers on the road;
We are here to help each other
Walk the mile and bear the load.
#3
I will hold the Christlight for you
In the night-time of your fear;
I will hold my hand out to you,
Speak the peace you long to hear.
#4
I will weep when you are weeping,
When you laugh I'll laugh with you;
I will share your joy and sorrow
Till we've seen this journey through.
#5
When we sing to God in heaven
We shall find such harmony,
Born of all we've known together
Of Christ's love and agony.
#6
Brother, let me be your servant,
Let me be as Christ to you;
Pray that I may have the grace
To let you be my servant, too.
