You Are Holy, You are mercy,
You are wonder, You are love.
You are faithful, You are gracious,
You are lovely, You are God.
#1
I open my eyes so I
See Your loveliness.
I open my life so I
Know Your holiness.
#2
If You are for us who could
Stand against us?
Surely You are with us,
Surely You are with us.
#3
Surely You are with us,
Surely You are with us,
Surely You are with us,
Surely You are with us.
