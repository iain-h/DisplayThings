Worthy is the lamb that once was slain
To receive all glory, power and praise
For with your blood you purchased us for God
Jesus, you are worthy, that is what you are
#1
Jesus, you are mercy
Jesus, you are justice
Jesus, you are worthy
That is what you are
#2
You died alone to save me
You rose so you could raise me
You did this all to make me
A chosen child of God

Perfect sacrifice, crushed by God for us
Bearing in your hurt, all that I deserve
Misjudged for my misdeeds, you suffered silently
The only guiltless man in all of history
