To receive wisdom and honour,
To receive power and strength,
To receive wealth and all glory,
Worthy is the Lamb.
#1
Worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy is the Lamb
That was slain.
(Repeat)
#2
Jesus is the Lamb,
Jesus is the Lamb,
Jesus is the Lamb
That was slain.
#3
Worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy is the Lamb
That was slain.
