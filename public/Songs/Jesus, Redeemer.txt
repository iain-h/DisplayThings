For You alone are wonderful,
You alone are Counsellor,
Everlasting Father,
Mighty in the heavens.
Never to forget the love
You displayed upon a cross,
Son of God, I thank You,
Prince of Peace, I love Your name.
#1
Jesus, Redeemer,
Friend and King to me.
My refuge, my comfort,
You're everything to me.
And this heart is on fire for You,
Yes, this heart is on fire for You.
#2
Saviour, Healer,
Just and true are You.
Now reigning in glory,
Most high and living God.
And this heart is in awe of You,
Yes, this heart is in awe of You.
