Knowing You, hearing You speak,
Seeing You move mysteriously.
Your whisperings in my soul's ear:
I want the friendship and the fear
Of knowing You.
#1
You Confide In Those Who Fear You,
Share the secrets of Your heart,
Friendship give to those who seek to
Honour You with every part.
Though I'm one of unclean lips, Lord,
I am crying 'Woe is me!'
Trying now to rid myself of
All the things that hinder me from...
#2
There is one thing You have spoken,
There are two things I have found:
You, O Lord, are ever loving,
You, O Lord, are always strong.
I am longing to discover
Both the closeness and the awe,
Feel the nearness of Your whisper,
Hear the glory of Your roar, just...
