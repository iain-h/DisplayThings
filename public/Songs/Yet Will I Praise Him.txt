Yet Will I Praise Him,
I will lift my hands to my Creator.
Yet will I praise Him,
My Saviour and my God.
Yet will I praise Him,
I will put my trust in my Provider.
Yet will I praise Him,
Lord Jehovah, Sovereign God.
#1
Though the fig tree doesn't blossom
And no ripened grapes appear,
Though the harvest fails
And fields provide no food;
I'll be joyful in my Saviour,
The Lord who is my strength;
He will keep my ways
And lead me in His truth.
#2
When the night is overwhelming
And the day is far from clear,
When my heart is restless
For the peace of God;
Let Your song, Lord, through the ages,
Through the prophets You have given,
Lift my mind and heart
To gaze upon You, Lord.
#3
Be the strength, Lord, in my weakness,
Let Your song be in my night;
Be my rock when all around is sinking sand.
Be the light, Lord, in my darkness,
Be the vision of my eyes:
In my passing days
You are the great 'I Am'.
