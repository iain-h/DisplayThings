And all to God, for all you are to me
There is nothing like, there is nothing like
Your love, your love
There is nothing like your love, your love

Father true and merciful
Bound to me with love
Adopted in, free from all sin
Jesus Saviour, glorified
Your offering none could give
I stand before you humbled and in awe

Holy Spirit, gift of God
Teach my sould to soar
Train me in your holy ways
Lord, I'll love you forever
I'll love you forever
Lord, I'll love you forever
I'll love you forever
