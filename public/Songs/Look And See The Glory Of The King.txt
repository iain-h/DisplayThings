Look and see the glory of the King,
Sense the presence of the Lord amongst His people.
Feel Him fill the temple of our lives
As He sits upon the throne of our praise.
#1
We are His church,
We are all God's own people.
We all proclaim that He is King, He is King.
#2
At God's right hand
Jesus Christ is exalted.
His rule is now, and shall be forever more.
