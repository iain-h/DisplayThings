I was once in darkness, now my eyes can see,
I was lost but Jesus sought and found me.
O what love He offers, O what peace He gives,
I will sing forever more, He lives.

Hallelujah Jesus! Hallelujah Lord!
Hallelujah Father, I am shielded by His word.
I will live forever, I will never die,
I will rise up to meet Him in the sky.
