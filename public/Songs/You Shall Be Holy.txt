#1
You shall be Holy
And in everything be true,
For I, the Lord, am holy,
And My word belongs to you.
#2
Stay in my presence,
Grow strong in My love,
With all the gifts I give you
From My kingdom here above.
#3
We are Your children,
Abba Father, mighty God,
And growing in Your likeness,
Through grace of Jesus' blood.
#4
Inspired by Your Spirit,
Our eternal source of power,
Release us to worship,
And to praise You every hour.
