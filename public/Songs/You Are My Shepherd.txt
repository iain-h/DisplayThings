#1
You Are My Shepherd, I have no needs.
You lead me by peaceful streams,
And You refresh my life.
You hold my hand and You guide my steps,
I could walk through the valley of death,
And I won't be afraid.
#2
Because You are in control.
You are in control.
You are in control.
You are in control.
#3
You cause everything to work together,
You truly have a sovereign plan,
And You know who I am,
And You made who I am,
And You love who I am.
