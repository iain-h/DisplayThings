And all I know is you have called me,
And that I will follow is all I can say.
I will go where you will send me,
And your fire lights my way.
#1
Though I feel afraid
Of territory unknown,
I know that I can say
That I do not stand alone.
For Jesus, you have promised
Your presence in my heart;
I cannot see the ending,
But it's here that I must start.
#2
What lies across the waves
May cause my heart to fear;
Will I survive the day,
Must I leave what's known and dear?
A ship that's in the harbour
Is still and safe from harm,
But it was not built to be there,
It was made for wind and storm.
