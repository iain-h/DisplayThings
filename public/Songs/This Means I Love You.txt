This Means I Love You,
Singing this song;
Lord, I don't have the words,
But I do have the will.
And this means I love You,
That I take up the cross,
I will sing as I walk out this love.
#1
Jesus, this life is for You,
Everything, Lord, that I do;
Deeds that are pleasing
And ways that are pure,
Lord, may my life bear this fruit.
#2
For these are the plans of my heart,
Yet often I'm missing the mark;
See my desire to live in Your truth,
This surely means I love You.
