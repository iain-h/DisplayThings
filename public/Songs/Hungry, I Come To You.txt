#C
I'm falling on my knees,
Offering all of me.
Jesus, You're all this heart is living for.
#1
Hungry, I Come To You,
For I know You satisfy.
I am empty, but I know
Your love does not run dry.
So I wait for You,
So I wait for You.
#2
Broken, I run to You,
For Your arms are open wide;
I am weary, but I know
Your touch restores my life.
So I wait for You,
So I wait for You.
