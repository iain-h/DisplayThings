#1
Jesus' love has got under our skin,
Jesus' love has got under our skin.
Deeper than colour oh;
Richer than culture oh;
Stronger than emotion oh;
Wider than the ocean oh.
Don't you want to celebrate
And congratulate somebody,
Talk about a family!
It's under our skin, under our skin.

Leader:	Everybody say love:
All:		love.
Leader:	Everybody say love:
All:		love,
Leader:	love,
All:		love.
#3
Isn't it good to be
Living in harmony.
Jesus in you and me;
He's under our skin,
Under our skin,
He's under our skin,
Under our skin.
