Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus, Jesus.
At the mention of Your name,
I worship.
#1
Just the mention of Your name
Causes me to fall before You,
Tears flow as I adore You,
At the mention of Your name,
Just the mention of Your name.
#2
Just the mention of Your name
Reaffirms the love that holds me,
Speaks once more of love that knows me,
At the mention of Your name,
Just the mention of Your name.
