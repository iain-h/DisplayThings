#C
You have called us out of darkness,
Out of darkness into your glorious light.
You have saved us from the darkness,
We rejoice in your power and might.
(Repeat)
#1
We are a chosen race,
A royal priesthood by your grace.
We are a holy nation
Set apart for you.
#2
We are to take your light
To every nation, tongue and tribe;
So they may see your glory
Shining through our lives.
