Jesus, You are
All that I am living for
And all that I believe is in You, Jesus,
All that I am living for
And all that I believe is in You.
#1
Everlasting, ever true,
All creation sings to You.
Ever faithful, living Lord,
Let the sound of praise be heard.
#2
Never changing, awesome God,
Sing the glory of the Lord.
Ever loving, holy One,
I will praise what You have done.
