Jesus reigns over sin,
Jesus reigns deep within,
Jesus is the King of kings.
Jesus brings life and breath,
Jesus rules over death
Jesus is the King of kings.
#1
Jesus, holy Lamb of God,
Who triumphed over sin;
Gentle, humble Lamb of God
With a lion's heart within,
You are Messiah
And you're coming back again.
#2
Jesus, mighty living Lord,
Whose face shines like the sun;
Awesome in your majesty,
You are God's Holy One,
You are Messiah
And you're coming back again.
#3
Jesus, Name above all names,
The most exalted One;
You are the Way, the Truth, the Life,
God's precious living Son,
You are Messiah
And you're coming back again.
