Let Your glory fall in this room,
Let it go forth from here to the nations.
Let Your fragrance rest in this place,
As we gather to seek Your face.
#1
Father of creation,
Unfold Your sovereign plan.
Raise up a chosen generation
That will march through the land.
All of creation is longing
For Your unveiling of power.
Would You release Your anointing;
O God, let this be the hour.
#2
Ruler of the nations,
The world has yet to see
The full release of Your promise,
The church in victory.
Turn to us, Lord, and touch us,
Make us strong in Your might.
Overcome our weakness,
That we could stand up and fight.
#3
Let Your kingdom come.
Let Your will be done.
Let us see on earth
The glory of Your Son.
