He is our fortress,
We will never be shaken.
He is our fortress,
We will never be shaken.
He is our fortress,
We will never be shaken.
He is our fortress,
We will never be shaken.
We will put our trust in God.
We will put our trust in God.

Our confidence is in the Lord,
The source of our salvation.
Rest is found in him alone,
The Author of creation.
We will not fear the evil day,
Because we have a refuge;
In every circumstance we say,
Our hope is built on Jesus.
