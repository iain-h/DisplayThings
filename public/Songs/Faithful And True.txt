Faithful and true
Are all Your ways;
Your love for me will never fade away.
Always the same,
You never change;
Your love for me will never fade away.
Even in my hour of deepest need,
You are always there to walk with me.
You know my words before I speak;
Lord, I know that You will never forsake me.
