And I bow my knee before You,
In honour of Your name,
For You alone are worthy,
Worthy of my praise,
Worthy of my praise.
#1
You are righteous in all Your ways,
You are good, You are good.
You are truthful in all You say,
You are good, You are good.
#2
You are holy, faithful and true,
You are good, You are good.
You are gracious in all You do,
You are good, You are good.
