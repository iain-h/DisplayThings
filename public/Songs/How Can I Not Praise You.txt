Hallelujah, praise the Lord, O my soul.
Hallelujah, it is You I adore.
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
Hallelujah, I am saved! I am saved!
Hallelujah, free to praise Your name.
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.

How Can I Not Praise You,
When I consider all You've done?
God of creation, all sufficient One.
How can I not worship
When I consider who You are?
You are my Master,
The One who has my heart.
#2
How can I not love You,
When Your love reached deep down to me?
Love so amazing, what a mystery.
How can I not give my all,
When You gave heaven's best to me?
Jesus, my treasure for all eternity.
