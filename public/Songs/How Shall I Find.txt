For You are the strength in my heart,
So faithful when other loves fail me.
Forever the strength in my heart:
Jesus, Jesus.
#1
How Shall I Find my place of rest,
True wisdom and the hand of God?
Not by my own understanding,
But by Your Spirit in me.
#2
How shall I know the kind of love
That cannot fade, that cannot fail?
Not from this world's empty treasure,
But by the promise of God.
#3
Your river flows, it covers me,
Its blessing fills my life always,
And sets my eyes on Your beauty
And fills my heart with a song.
