O my Lord, You are most glorious,
King of kings and Prince of Peace.
By Your word this world was created;
By Your love I have been set free.
And I lift my hands in worship up to Your throne,
I will declare how much You mean to me.
You are my Lord, it's You I worship;
Son of God, You reign in majesty.
