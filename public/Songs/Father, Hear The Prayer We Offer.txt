#1
Father, Hear The Prayer We Offer:
Not for ease that prayer shall be,
But for strength, that we may ever
Live our lives courageously.
#2
Not for ever in green pastures
Do we ask our way to be:
But by steep and rugged pathways
Would we strive to climb to Thee.
#3
Not for ever by still waters
Would we idly quiet stay;
But would smite the living fountains
From the rocks along our way.
#4
Be our strength in hours of weakness,
In our wanderings be our Guide;
Through endeavour, failure, danger,
Father, be Thou at our side.
#5
Let our path be bright or dreary,
Storm or sunshine be our share;
May our souls, in hope unweary,
Make Thy work our ceaseless prayer.
#A
