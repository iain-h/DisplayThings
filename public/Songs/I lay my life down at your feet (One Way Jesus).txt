One way Jesus
You're the only one that I could live for.
One way Jesus
You're the only one that I could live for.
#1
I lay my life down at your feet, you're the only one I need
I turn to you and you are always there
In troubled times its you I seek, I put you first that's all I need
I humble all I am, and all to you
#2
You are always, always there, every how and everywhere
Your grace abounds so deeply within me
You will never ever change, yesterday today the same
Forever till forever meets no end

You are the way the truth and the life
We live by faith and not by sight for you
We're living all for you
