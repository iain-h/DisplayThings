Thine be the glory,
Risen, conquering Son,
Endless is the victory
Over death you won.

Thine be the glory,
Risen, conquering Son,
Endless is the victory
Over death you won.
Angels in bright clothing
Rolled the stone away,
Kept the folded grave-clothes
Where your body lay.
#2
Lo! Jesus meets us,
Risen from the tomb;
Lovingly he greets us,
Scatters fear and gloom.
Let the church with gladness
Songs of triumph sing,
For the Lord now lives and
Death hast lost its sting.
#3
No more we doubt you,
Glorious Prince of Life;
Life is naught without you:
Help us in our strife.
Make us more than conquerors
Through your deathless love;
Bring us safe through this life
To your home above.
