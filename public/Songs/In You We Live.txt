#1
In You We Live, Jesus,
In You we move.
In You we breathe, Jesus,
In You we love.
And we are Your body here,
We are Your body here.
#2
Your touch - our hands,
Your words - our voice,
Your way - our feet,
Your tears in our eyes,
Your Spirit is here.
#3
You give - we share,
You lead - we go,
You send - we serve,
You build and we grow.
Your Spirit is here.
#4
Across the world, You're moving;
The sound of prayer is growing stronger,
From every tribe and nation
Joining in one salvation song.
#5
You are the light that's dawning,
You are the hope transforming all things;
Freeing the whole creation
To join in one salvation song,
One song.
