#1
I Will Never Be The Same
Now my eyes are open wide.
I have been forever changed
Through the power of His blood.
#2
I will triumph in the cross
That my Saviour bore for me.
I will stand with confidence
Because of Jesus.
I no longer fear the grave,
I'm a child of His grace.
I no longer feel ashamed,
Because of Jesus.
