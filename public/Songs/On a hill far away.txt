So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown.
#1
On a hill far away,
Stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I loved that old cross
Where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.
#2
O, that old rugged cross,
So despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me:
For the dear Lamb of God
Left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.
#3
In the old rugged cross,
Stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see.
For 'twas on that old cross
Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sanctify me.
#4
To the old rugged cross
I will ever be true,
Its shame and reproach gladly bear.
Then he'll call me some day
To my home far away;
There His glory for ever I'll share.
