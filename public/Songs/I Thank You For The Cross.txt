#1
I Thank You For The Cross
Where all my shame was laid,
Broken by Your power,
Banished to the grave.
You gave Yourself for me,
A sinner for a King,
Offering Your death
And suffering my sin.
#2
And I will give my life
To You, Lord,
For with grace You came
To pay the ransom for my soul.
And I will live my life
For You, Lord.
You brought me back from death,
Into Your mercy on the cross.
