We are Your inheritance,
We are Your reward.

And You're our glory
And the lifter of our heads;
You're our glory
And the lifter of our heads.

Listen, can you hear it?
The Spirit and the Bride.

Maranatha! Come!'
Whisper 'Jesus!
Maranatha! Come!'

O come, O come to us!
O come, O come to us!
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
O come, O come to us!
