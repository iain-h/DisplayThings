You are my God,
You're everything to me;
There's no one like You, my Lord,
No one like You.
You are my God.
You're everything to me;
There's no one like You, my Lord,
No one like You.
#1
There's no one like You, my Lord,
No one could take Your place;
My heart beats to worship You,
I live just to seek Your face.
There's no one like You, my Lord,
No one could take Your place;
There's no one like You, my Lord,
No one like You.
#2
There's no one like You, my Lord,
No one could take Your place;
I long for Your presence, Lord,
To serve You is my reward.
There's no one like You, my Lord,
No one could take Your place;
There's no one like You, my Lord,
No one like You.
