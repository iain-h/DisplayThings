Calling all nations, hear the story
Of God's amazing grace.
Calling all nations, come and worship,
Fill the earth with praise.
#1
Every woman, every man,
Rich and poor, old and young,
Heaven's love is coming down
To wipe all your tears away.
#2
There's a bell to be rung,
There's a song to be sung.
Sweeter music yet to play
When we gather on that day.
