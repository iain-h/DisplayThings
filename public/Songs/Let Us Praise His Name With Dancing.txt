#C
Dance, dance, dance before the King.
Dance, dance, celebrate and sing.
#1
Let us praise His name with dancing
And with the tambourine.
Let us praise His name with dancing,
Make a joyful noise and sing.
#2
Let us celebrate with dancing;
The King has set us free.
Let us celebrate with dancing,
Rejoice in victory.
