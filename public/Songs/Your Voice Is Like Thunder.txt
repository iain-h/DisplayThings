#1
Your voice is like thunder,
Your eyes like fire;
Your throne is forever,
In unapproachable light.
Your grace is so tender,
Your love like wine;
To You I surrender,
I lay down my life.
#2
And all I want to do
Is to build a house of gold,
Purest silver and costly stones;
Let it stand when the fire comes,
When the day brings Your light.
Be my wisdom and be my strength,
Fill me up with Your faithfulness;
Keep me loving until the end.
Let the fire in Your eyes
See a living sacrifice,
Pleasing in Your sight.

Let me build a house of gold
Purest silver and costly stones;

When the day brings Your light.
Be my wisdom and be my strength,
Fill me up with Your faithfulness;
Keep me loving until the end.
Let the fire in Your eyes
See a living sacrifice,
Pleasing in Your sight.
