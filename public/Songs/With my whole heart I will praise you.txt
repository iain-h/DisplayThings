With my whole heart I will praise you,
Holding nothing back, hallelujah!
You have made me glad and now
I come with open arms to thank you,
With my heart embrace, hallelujah!
I can see your face is smiling.
With my whole life I will serve you,
Captured by your love, hallelujah!
O amazing love! O amazing love!

Lord, your heart is overflowing
With a love divine, hallelujah!
And this love is mine for ever.
Now your joy has set you laughing
As you join the song, hallelujah!
Heaven sings along, I hear the
Voices swell to great crescendos,
Praising your great love, hallelujah!
O amazing love! O amazing love!
#3
Come, O Bridegroom, clothed in splendour,
My Beloved One, hallelujah!
How I long to run and meet you.
You're the fairest of ten thousand,
You're my life and breath, hallelujah!
Love as strong as death has won me.
All the rivers, all the oceans
Cannot quench this love, hallelujah!
O amazing love! O amazing love!
