I will only worship You,
There is nothing I want more
Than to be with You,
More and more I love You, Lord.
The only One I bow before,
I worship You with all that You've put in me;
This is what You made me for.
#1
Almighty God, I have heard of Your fame;
I stand in awe of Your wondrous deeds.
The heavens declare Your glorious name;
I worship You above all my needs.
#2
The skies display the work of Your hands,
I will praise You for the rest of my days.
Who can You ask to approve Your plans?
For You are sovereign in all of Your ways.
