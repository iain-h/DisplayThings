I will exalt You, O Lord,
I will exalt You, O Lord.
Praise Your holy name,
That my heart may sing to You;
I will exalt You, O Lord.

Your love, O Lord,
It reaches to the heavens;
Your faithfulness,
It reaches to the skies.
Your righteousness is like
The mighty mountains;
How priceless is Your faithful love.
#2
Your name, O Lord,
It is a mighty tower;
Your glory
It covers all the earth.
In Your hands alone
Are strength and power,
All praise to be Your glorious name.
