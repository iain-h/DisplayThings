#1
I am so thankful
For the fullness of your love.
I am so thankful
For the shedding of your blood.
I am so thankful
You died in my place
Oh, Lord, I'm thankful for your love.
#2
I am so thankful
That you came into my life.
I am so thankful
That you love me like a child.
I am so thankful
I'll be with you for all time.
Oh, Lord, I'm thankful for your love.
