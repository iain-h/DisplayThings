Hear, O Lord, our cry,
Revive us, revive us again.
For the sake of Your glory,
Revive us, revive us again.
Lord, hear our cry.
Lord, hear our cry.

Hear, O Lord, our cry,
Revive us, revive us again.
For the sake of the children,
Revive us, revive us again.
Lord, hear our cry.
Lord, hear our cry.
