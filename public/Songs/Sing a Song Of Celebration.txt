Oh, we will dance on the streets that are golden,
The glorious bride and the great Son of man,
From every tongue and tribe and nation
Will join in the song of the Lamb.
#1
Sing a song of celebration,
Lift up a shout of praise
For the bridegroom will come,
The glorious One.
And oh, we will look on His face;
We'll go to a much better place.
#2
Dance with all your might,
Lift up your hands and clap for joy:
The time's drawing near
When He will appear.
And Oh, we will stand by His side;
A strong, pure, spotless bride.
#3
Sing aloud for the time of rejoicing is near.
The risen King, our groom is soon to appear.
The wedding feast to come is now near at hand.
Lift up your voice, proclaim the coming Lamb.
