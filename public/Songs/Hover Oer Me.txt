Fill me now, fill me now,
Jesus, come and fill me now.
Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
Jesus, come and fill me now.
#1
Hover O'er Me, Holy Spirit,
Bathe my trembling heart and brow;
Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
Come, O come and fill me now.
#2
Thou can fill me, gracious Spirit,
Though I cannot tell Thee how;
But I need Thee, greatly need Thee,
Come, O come and fill me now.
#3
I am weakness, full of weakness,
At Thy sacred feet I bow;
Blest, divine, eternal Spirit,
Come with power, and fill me now.
