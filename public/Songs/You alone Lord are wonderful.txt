And I exalt you, my Lord,
I exalt you, my Lord,
I exalt you, my Lord and my King.
I exalt you, my Lord,
I exalt you, my Lord,
For you are my God and King.
#1
You alone, Lord, are wonderful.
Father, you alone are wise.
Your love, Lord, is eternal,
Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
#2
And I adore you, Lord.
I stand in awe of you,
For all of your ways are so great.
Yes, I adore you, Lord.
I stand in awe of you,
For all of your ways are so great.
