Alleluia! alleluia!
Opening our hearts to Him,
Singing alleluia! alleluia!
Jesus is our King!
#1
Create in us, O God
A humble heart that sets us free
To proclaim the wondrous majesty
Of our Father in heaven.
#2
We bear the name of Christ,
Justified, we meet with Him.
His words and presence calm our fear,
Revealing God our Father here.
#3
Let kindred voices join,
Honouring the Lamb of God
Who teaches us by bread and wine
The mystery of His body.
#4
Pour out Your Spirit on us,
Empowering us to live as one,
To carry Your redeeming love
To a world enslaved by sin.
