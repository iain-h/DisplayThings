By our voices be lifted, lifted,
By our actions, Lord, be lifted high.
By our love, Lord, be lifted, lifted,
By our lives, O Lord, be lifted high.
#1
Lord, we lift you high
When we praise your name,
When we worship you
And our hands are raised,
That is how we lift you up.
Lord, we lift you high
When we tell the truth,
When we give our best
In everything we do,
That is how we lift you up.
#2
Lord, we lift you high
When we're good and kind,
When we turn from wrong
And we do what's right,
That is how we lift you up.
Lord, we lift you high
When we shine like stars,
When we tell our friends
Just how good you are,
That is how we lift you up.
#3
You are God, Jesus the Lord of all,
We place you above all else.
So shine through me
And keep drawing the world
To your heart.
Lord, we lift you high
When we praise your name,
When we worship you
And our hands are raised,
That is how we lift you up.
Lord, we lift you high
When we tell the truth,
When we give our best
In everything we do,
That is how we lift you up.
