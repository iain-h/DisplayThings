Save the lost! Save the lost!
Spend your might for them;
Give your life for them.
Save the lost! Save the lost!
Don't back down on it;
Win your crown in it,
Soldiers of our God,
Soldiers of our God.
#1
Soldiers Of Our God, Arise!
The day is drawing nearer;
Shake the slumber from your eyes,
The light is growing clearer.
Sit no longer idly by
While the heedless millions die.
O, lift the blood-stained banner high,
And take the field for Jesus.
#2
See the brazen hosts of hell
Their art and power employing,
More than human tongue can tell
The blood-bought souls destroying.
See on ruin's hell-bound road
Victims groan beneath their load;
Go forward, O you sons of God,
And dare or die for Jesus.
#3
Warriors of the risen King,
Great army of salvation,
Spread His fame, His praises sing
And conquer every nation.
Raise the glorious standard higher,
Work for victory, never tire;
O, forward march with blood and fire,
And win the world for Jesus.
