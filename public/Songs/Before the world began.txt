Come to the Father
Though your gift is small,
Broken hearts, broken lives,
He will take them all.
The power of the Word,
The power of His blood,
Everything was done
So you would come.
#1
Before the world began
You were on His mind,
And every tear you cry
Is precious in His eyes.
Because of His great love,
He gave His only Son;
Everything was done,
So you would come.
#2
Nothing you can do
Could make him love you more,
And nothing that you've done
Could make him close the door.
Because of His great love,
He gave His only Son;
Everything was done
So you would come.
