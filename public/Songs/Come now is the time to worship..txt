Come now is the time to worship
Come now is the time to give your heart
Come just as you are to worship
Come just as you are before your God, come
#1
One day every tongue will confess you are God
One day every knee will bow
Still the greatest treasure remains for those
Who gladly choose you now
#2
Willingly we choose to surrender our lives
Willingly our knees will bow
With all our heart, soul, mind and strength
We gladly choose You now
#3
Thank you for the hope that is in our hearts
Lord it's at your throne we bow
Help us to receive and return the love
You freely give us now
