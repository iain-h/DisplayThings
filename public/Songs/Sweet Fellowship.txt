Sweet fellowship, Jesus in the midst,
Life blossoms in the church,
Men by men are blessed
When Jesus is in the midst.
#2
Peace and harmony-Jesus reigning here;
The church moves at His command,
No room for doubt or fear,
For Jesus is reigning here.
#3
I've never known a time like this,
Feel the spirit within me rise.
Come and see what God is doing.
Lord, we love You.
#4
Sweet fellowship, Jesus in the midst,
Life blossoms in the church,
Men by men are blessed
When Jesus is in the midst.
