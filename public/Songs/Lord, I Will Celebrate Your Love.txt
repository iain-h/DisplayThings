#1
Lord, I will celebrate Your love,
From deep within my heart,
I celebrate Your love;
I celebrate Your love given to me.
#2
You are the one that I adore;
Lord, in Your presence is life forever more;
The one that I adore.
You are my Lord.
#3
Healing me, releasing me,
More and more reveal Yourself in me,
My Lord, my Lord!
