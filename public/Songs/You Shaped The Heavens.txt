#C
You are the Maker of all things,
First and the Last;
Creation sings praise to You, God.
You're reigning in glory,
Ancient of Days;
Your people sing praise to You, God.
#1
You Shaped The Heavens and the earth,
Revealed Your splendour.
You spoke Your life into our hearts,
So we belong to You.
#2
Creator God, in You all things
Now hold together,
Working Your wonders day by day,
You'll reign forever.
#3
And earth joins with heaven
Declaring Your glory;
Proclaiming the works of Your hands.
(Repeat)
