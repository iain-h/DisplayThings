#1
Lo, he comes with clouds descending,
Once for mortal sinners slain;
Thousand, thousand saints attending
Swell the triumph of His train.
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
Christ appears on earth to reign.
#2
Every eye shall now behold him
Robed in glorious majesty;
We who set at naught and sold him,
Pierced and nailed him to the tree,
Deeply wailing, deeply wailing, deeply wailing,
Shall the true Messiah see.
#3
Those dear tokens of His passion
Still His dazzling body bears,
Cause of endless exultation
To His ransomed worshippers:
With what rapture, with what rapture, with what rapture
Gaze we on those glorious scars!
#4
Yea, amen, let all adore thee,
High on thine eternal throne;
Saviour, take the pow'r and glory,
Claim the kingdom for thine own.
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
Thou shalt reign, and thou alone.
