#C
And it's from the old I travel to the new,
Keep me travelling along with You.
#1
One More Step Along The World I Go,
One more step along the world I go,
From the old things to the new,
Keep me travelling along with You.
#2
Round the corners of the world I turn,
More and more about the world I learn.
All the new things that I see,
You'll be looking at along with me.
#3
As I travel through the bad and good,
Keep me travelling the way I should.
Where I see no way to go,
You'll be telling me the way, I know.
#4
Give me courage when the world is rough,
Keep me loving when the world is tough.
Leap and sing in all I do,
Keep me travelling along with You.
#5
You are older than the world can be,
You are younger than the life in me.
Ever old and ever new,
Keep me travelling along with You.
