On this, their wedding day,
We ask you, Lord, to stay,
And by your Spirit join these hearts together.
And from this moment on,
Teach them your lover's song,
That all the world may hear
A three-part harmony,
A three-part harmony.
#1
On this day of happiness,
We have gathered here to bless
The union of two lives in holy love.
Love's blossoming is now expressed
In solemn vows and promises,
With flowers and golden rings, a wedding dress.
We look around with joy to see
The smiles of friends and family
As witness to this day.
But, best of all, a friend unseen
Is here with us, and once again,
Water turns to wine.
#2
Oh, may this song of love ring clear
Though health or sickness, joy or tears,
For as long as both of them shall live.
May they harmonise with heaven above,
Stay tuned into the key of love,
Keep their eyes on Jesus day by day.
And may the music of their days
Become a symphony of praise
In honour of their Lord.
And may the song become a dance
To celebrate the great romance
Of Jesus and His bride.
