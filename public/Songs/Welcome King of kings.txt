Welcome, King of kings!
How great is your name.
You come in majesty
For ever to reign.
#1
You rule the nations, they shake
At the sound of your name.
To you is given all pow'r
And you shall reign.
#2
Let all creation bow down
At the sound of your name.
Let every tongue now confess,
The Lord God reigns.
Let all creation bow down
At the sound of your name.
Let every tongue now confess,
The Lord God reigns.
