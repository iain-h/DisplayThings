O l will sing unto You with joy, O Lord,
For You're the rock of my salvation,
Come before You with thanksgiving
And extol You with a song.
For You're the greatest King above all else,
You hold the depths of the earth in Your hand.
O I will sing unto You with joy, O Lord,
For You're the rock of my salvation.
