Jesus You are the saviour of my soul
And forever and ever I'll give my praises to You
Jesus You are the saviour of my soul
And forever and ever I'll give my praises to You

You know that I love You
You know that I want to 
Know you so much more
More than I have before

These words are from my heart
These words are not made up
'I will live for You'
'I am devoted to You'.

King of majesty, I have one desire
Just to be with You my Lord
Just to be with You my Lord
