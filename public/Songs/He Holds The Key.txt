Allelu, alleluia.
Allelu, alleluia, Lord.
#1
He holds the key to salvation,
Jesus is over all.
He is the Lord of creation:
#2
He is the Rock ever standing,
No man could break Him down.
He is the Truth everlasting:
#3
He is a Light in the darkness,
All men shall see His face.
He breaks all chains to redeem us:
#4
All power to Him who is mighty,
All praise to Him who is God.
All glory now and for ever:
