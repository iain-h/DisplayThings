#1
Lord, I Come To You,
Broken and lost,
Jesus, be the highest part.
Here I am again,
Longing for more,
Waiting for Your presence, here,
Your presence here.
#2
And how can I do anything but praise You?
How can I not worship You,
And how can I live my life
Without You, God?
Lord, You amaze me with Your favour,
Lord, You astound me with Your love,
And how can I live my life
Without You, God?
