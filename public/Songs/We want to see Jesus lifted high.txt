We want to see, we want to see,
We want to see Jesus lifted high.
We want to see, we want to see,
We want to see Jesus lifted high.
#1
We want to see Jesus lifted high,
A banner that flies across this land,
That all men might see the truth
And know he is the way to heaven.
(Repeat)
#2
Step by step we're moving forward,
Little by little taking ground,
Every prayer a powerful weapon,
Strongholds come tumbling down,
And down, and down, and down.

We're gonna see, we're gonna see,
We're gonna see Jesus lifted high.
