Great and wonderful are Thy wondrous deeds,
O Lord God the Almighty.
Just and true are all Thy ways, O Lord,
King of the ages art Thou.
Who shall not fear and glorify
Thy name, O Lord?
For Thou alone art holy,
Thou alone.
All the nations shall come and worship Thee,
For Thy glory shall be revealed.
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Amen.
Lai, lai, lai... (etc.)
