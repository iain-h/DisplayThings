#1
How lovely on the mountains
Are the feet of him
Who brings good news, good news,
Proclaiming peace,
Announcing news of happiness:
Our God reigns, our God reigns,
Our God reigns, our God reigns,
Our God reigns, our God reigns!
#2
You watchmen, lift your voices
Joyfully as one,
Shout for your King, your King.
See eye to eye
The Lord restoring Zion:
Your God reigns, your God reigns!
#3
Waste places of Jerusalem,
Break forth with joy,
We are redeemed, redeemed.
The Lord has saved
And comforted His people:
Your God reigns, your God reigns!
#4
Ends of the earth,
See the salvation of your God,
Jesus is Lord, is Lord.
Before the nations
He has bared His holy arm:
Your God reigns, your God reigns!
