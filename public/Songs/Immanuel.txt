Immanuel,
God is with us,
Immanuel,
He is here.
Immanuel,
He is among us,
Immanuel,
His kingdom is here.
#1
Wonderful counsellor, they laughed at His wisdom,
The Mighty God on a dusty road.
Everlasting Father, a friend of sinners,
The Prince of Peace in a cattle stall.
#2
He was despised and rejected,
A man of sorrows acquainted with grief.
From Him we turned and hid our faces;
He was despised, Him we did not esteem.
#3
But He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities.
On Him was the punishment that made us whole,
And by His stripes we are healed.
#4
He was oppressed, He was afflicted,
And yet He opened not His mouth.
Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
Like a sheep before his shearers He did not speak.
