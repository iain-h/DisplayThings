I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
With all my strength
With all I am
I will seek to honor His command
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb.

I have heard how christians long ago
Were brought before a tyrants throne
And they were told that he would spare their lives
If they would renounce the name of Christ.
But one by one they chose to die
The Son of God they would not deny
Like a great angelic choir sings
I can almost hear their voices ring.

Now the years have come and the years have gone
But the cause of Jesus still goes on
And now our time has come to count the cost
To reject this world, and embrace the cross
And one by one let us live our lives
For the One who died to give us life.
Till the trumpet sounds on the final day
Let us proudly stand and boldly say.
#B
To the Lamb of God who bore my pain
Who took my place, Who wore my shame.
I will seek to honour His commands
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb.
