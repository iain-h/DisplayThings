I've found Jesus, I've found Jesus,
I've found Jesus, I've found Jesus.
#1
Well, I hear they're singing in the streets
That Jesus is alive,
And all creation shouts aloud
That Jesus is alive;
Now surely we can all be changed
'cos Jesus is alive;
And everybody here can know
That Jesus is alive.
#2
And I will live for all my days
To raise a banner of truth and light,
To sing about my Saviour's love
And the best thing that happened
It was the day I met you.
#3
Well, I feel like dancing in the streets
'cos Jesus is alive,
To join with all who celebrate
That Jesus is alive.
The joy of God is in this town
'cos Jesus is alive;
For everybody's seen the truth
That Jesus is alive.
#B
Well, you lifted me from where I was,
Set my feet upon a rock,
Humbled that you even know 'bout me.
Now I have chosen to believe,
Believing that you've chosen me;
I was lost but now I've found
