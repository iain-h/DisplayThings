O worship the Lord
In the beauty of holiness;
Bow down before him,
His glory proclaim;
With gold of obedience,
And incense of lowliness,
Kneel and adore him:
The Lord is His name.
#2
Low at His feet lay
Thy burden of carefulness:
High on His heart
He will bear it for thee,
Comfort thy sorrows,
And answer thy prayerfulness,
Guiding thy steps
As may best for thee be.
#3
Fear not to enter
His courts in the slenderness
Of the poor wealth
Thou wouldst reckon as thine:
Truth in its beauty,
And love in its tenderness,
These are the offerings
To lay on His shrine.
#4
These, though we bring them
In trembling and fearfulness,
He will accept
For the name that is dear;
Mornings of joy give
For evenings of tearfulness,
Trust for our trembling
And hope for our fear.
#5
O worship the Lord
In the beauty of holiness;
Bow down before him,
His glory proclaim;
With gold of obedience,
And incense of lowliness,
Kneel and adore him:
The Lord is His name.
