On Christ our solid ground,
Our hope for life is found;
The joy of our salvation.
On Christ our solid ground,
Our hope for life is found.
There is no condemnation.
There is no condemnation.
#1
This Is Love, not that we loved Him,
But that He first loved us.
Left behind glories of heaven;
Took on the shame of the cross.
But in the place where love was poured
Death could not hold our risen Lord.
#2
This is peace, not as the world gives,
But the true peace of Christ.
You have claimed our hearts for heaven;
Living by faith, not by sight.
Strengthen our faith in You alone
Until we stand before Your throne.
