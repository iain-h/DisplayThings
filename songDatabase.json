It takes more than ropes or nails to pin Him to the wooden crossbars: love is the real shackle that holds Him there. The great leader is led - by love; the truest, purest model of what any leader should be.","He dies, and a curtain in the Temple is ripped from top to bottom; the conflict between heaven and earth settled by His great work.
