#1
Our passion is for You, Lord Jesus;
Your grace has fuelled a fire
That burns within our hearts.
There's nowhere that compares
With Your presence;
We've tasted of Your Spirit,
So there's just one thing we ask:
#2
More, more, more, more, more.
More, more, more, more, more.
Pour out, pour out,
Pour out Your Spirit, O Lord.
Pour out, pour out,
Pour out Your Spirit, O Lord
