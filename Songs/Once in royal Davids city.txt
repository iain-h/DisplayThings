#1
Once in royal David's city
Stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her baby
In a manger for His bed:
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ her little child.
#2
He came down to earth from heaven,
Who is God and Lord of all,
And His shelter was a stable,
And His cradle was a stall;
With the poor and meek and lowly,
Lived on earth our Saviour holy.
#3
And through all His wondrous childhood
Day by day like us he grew;
He was little, weak and helpless,
Tears and smiles like us he knew;
And he feeleth for our sadness,
And he shareth in our gladness.
#4
Still among the poor and lowly
Hope in Christ is brought to birth,
With the promise of salvation
For the nations of the earth;
Still in him our life is found
And our hope of heav'n is crowned.
#5
And our eyes at last shall see him
Through His own redeeming love,
For that child so dear and gentle
Is our Lord in heav'n above;
And he leads His children on
To the place where he is gone.
#6
Not in that poor lowly stable,
With the oxen standing by,
We shall see him, but in heaven,
Set at God's right hand on high;
When like stars His children crowned,
All in white shall wait around.
