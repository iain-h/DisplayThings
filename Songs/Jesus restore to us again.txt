The word is near,
Here in our mouths
And in our hearts,
The word of faith;
Proclaim it on the Spirit's breath:
Jesus.
#1
Jesus, restore to us again
The gospel of your holy name,
That comes with pow'r, not words alone,
Owned, signed and sealed from heaven's throne.
Spirit and word in one agree;
The promise to the power wed.
#2
Your word, O Lord, eternal stands,
Fixed and unchanging in the heav'ns.
The Word made flesh, to earth came down
To heal our world with nail-pierced hands.
Among us here you lived and breathed,
You are the message we received.
#3
Spirit of truth, lead us, we pray,
Into all truth as we obey.
And as God's will we gladly choose,
Your ancient pow'r again will prove
Christ's teaching truly comes from God,
He is indeed the living Word.
#4
Upon the heights of this dark land
With Moses and Elijah stand.
Reveal your glory once again,
Show us your face, declare your name.
Prophets and law, in you, complete
Where promises and power meet.
#5
Grant us in this decisive hour
To know the Scriptures and the pow'r;
The knowledge in experience proved,
The pow'r that moves and works by love.
May words and works join hands as one,
The word go forth, the Spirit come.
