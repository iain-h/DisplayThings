#1
Make me, Lord, a dreamer for Your kingdom;
Plant in my heart heavenly desires.
Grant faith that can say, impossibilities shall be,
And vision lest a world should perish not knowing Thee.
#2
Make me, Lord, a dreamer for Your kingdom;
I would aspire to greater goals in God.
So cause faith to rise, to motivate each word and deed,
A faith that's well convinced that Jesus meets every need.
#3
Make me, Lord, a dreamer for Your kingdom,
Dreams that will change a world that's lost its way.
May dreams that first found their birth in Your omnipotence,
Come alive in me, becoming reality.
