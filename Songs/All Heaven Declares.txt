All heav'n declares
The glory of the risen Lord.
Who can compare
With the beauty of the Lord?
For ever he will be
The Lamb upon the throne.
I gladly bow the knee
And worship him alone.

I will proclaim
The glory of the risen Lord.
Who once was slain
To reconcile us to God.
For ever you will be
The Lamb upon the throne.
I gladly bow the knee
And worship you alone.
