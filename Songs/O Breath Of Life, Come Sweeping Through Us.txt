#1
O breath of life, come sweeping through us,
Revive Thy church with life and power.
O Breath of Life, come, cleanse, renew us,
And fit Thy church to meet this hour.
#2
O Wind of God, come, bend us, break us,
Till humbly we confess our need;
Then in Thy tenderness remake us,
Revive, restore; for this we plead.
#3
O Breath of Love, come, breathe within us,
Renewing thought and will and heart:
Come, love of Christ, afresh to win us,
Revive Thy church in every part.
#4
Revive us, Lord! is zeal abating
While harvest fields are vast and white?
Revive us, Lord, the world is waiting,
Equip Thy church to spread the light.
