Walk in the light,
Walk in the light,
Walk in the light,
Walk in the light of the Lord.
#1
The Spirit Lives To Set Us Free,
Walk, walk in the light;
He binds us all in unity,
Walk, walk in the light.
#2
Jesus promised life to all,
Walk, walk in the light;
The dead were wakened by His call,
Walk, walk in the light.
#3
He died in pain on Calvary,
Walk, walk in the light;
To save the lost like you and me,
Walk, walk in the light.
#4
We know His death was not the end,
Walk, walk in the light;
He gave His Spirit to be our friend,
Walk, walk in the light.
#5
By Jesus' love our wounds are healed,
Walk, walk in the light;
The Father's kindness is revealed,
Walk, walk in the light.
#6
The Spirit lives in you and me,
Walk, walk in the light;
His light will shine for all to see,
Walk, walk in the light.
