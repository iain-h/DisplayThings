So we might see Your glory,
So we might see Your face.
So we can feel Your heartbeat,
And hear You call our name.
#1
Light of the world, shine Your light
Into my heart.
God of love, pierce my soul
With Your mercy.
#2
Fire of God, burn away
What is not holy.
Jesus, take our hearts
And make them new.
