You are my everything,
You who made earth and sky and sea,
All that You've placed inside of me
Calls out Your name.
To You I bow,
The King who commands my every breath,
The Man who has conquered sin and death,
My Lord and my King,
My everything!

Lord how majestic You are,
My eyes meet Your gaze
And my burden is lifted.
Your word is a lamp to my feet,
Your hand swift to bless
And Your banner a shield.
#2
Lord, how resplendent You are,
When I think of Your heavens,
The work of Your fingers-
What is man, that You are mindful of him?
Yet You've crowned him with glory
And caused him to reign!
