Send me out from here, Lord,
To serve a world in need.
May I know no man by the coat he wears,
But the heart that Jesus sees.
And may the light of Your face
Shine upon me, Lord.
You have filled my heart with the greatest joy,
And my cup is overflowing.

‘go now, and carry the news
To all creation, every race and tongue.
Take no purse with you,
Take nothing to eat
For He will supply your needs.'
‘Go now, bearing the light,
Living for others,
Fearlessly walking into the night;
Take no thought for your lives,
Like lambs among wolves,
Full of the Spirit, ready to die.'
