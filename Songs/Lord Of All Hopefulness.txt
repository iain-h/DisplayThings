#1
Lord of all hopefulness,
Lord of all joy,
Whose trust, ever child-like,
No cares could destroy;
Be there at our waking,
And give us, we pray,
Your bliss in our hearts, Lord,
At the break of the day.
#2
Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all faith,
Whose strong hands were skilled
At the plane and the lathe;
Be there at our labours,
And give us, we pray,
Your strength in our hearts, Lord,
At the noon of the day.
#3
Lord of all kindliness, Lord of all grace,
Your hands swift to welcome,
Your arms to embrace;
Be there at our homing,
And give us, we pray,
Your love in our hearts, Lord,
At the eve of the day.
#4
Lord of all gentleness, Lord of all calm,
Whose voice is contentment,
Whose presence is balm;
Be there at our sleeping,
And give us, we pray,
Your peace in our hearts, Lord,
At the end of the day.
