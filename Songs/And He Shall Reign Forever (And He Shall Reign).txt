And He shall reign forever
His throne and crown
Shall ever endure
And He shall reign forever
And we shall reign with Him
#1
What a vision filled my eyes
One like a Son of Man
Coming with the clouds of heav'n
He approached an awesome throne
#2
He was given sovereign pow'r
Glory and authority
Ev'ry nation, tribe and tongue
Worshipped him on bended knee
#3
On the throne forever
See the Lamb who once was slain
Wounds of sacrificial love
Forever shall remain
