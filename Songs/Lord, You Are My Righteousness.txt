Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus, Jesus.
#1
Lord, You Are My Righteousness
The One who sanctifies my life,
My Shepherd and my guide.
Banner of deliverance,
Warrior and my defence,
In Your secret place I hide.
Every other throne must fall
And proclaim You Lord of all
At the mention of Your name;
My salvation and my light,
In Your presence I abide
And Your righteousness I claim.
#2
Though You are the King of kings,
Yet You are my next of kin,
And my nearest friend.
Laying down Your life for me,
Your amazing grace I see,
And Your love without an end.
How can I keep silent, Lord?
Even stones obey Your word
And they give to You their praise.
You're the Lord of everything,
All creation's voices sing
Of the glory of Your name.
