Saviour, He can move the mountains,
My God is Mighty to save,
He is Mighty to save
Forever, Author of salvation,
He rose and conquered the grave,
Jesus conquered the grave.

Everyone needs compassion,
Love that's never failing;
Let mercy fall on me.
Everyone needs forgiveness,
The kindness of a Saviour;
The Hope of nations.
#2
So take me as You find me,
All my fears and failures,
Fill my life again.
I give my life to follow
Everything I believe in,
Now I surrender.
