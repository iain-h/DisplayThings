And I know I cannot go from Your presence, O Lord,
But I need to feel You here with me.
What can I do just to draw near to You?
Oh, I need to know You here with me now.
#1
I Come To You, Lord of all hope,
Giver of life, revive my soul.
I wait for You, Prince of all peace,
King of all love, draw near to me.
It feels sometimes like You're far away,
Yet I know You are with me.
#2
Come to me now, Lord of my heart,
I need to know unfailing love.
Consuming flame, passion and power,
Come let Your fire burn in me now.
It feels sometimes like You're far away,
Yet I know You are with me.
