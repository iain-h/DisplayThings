Let the righteous sing,
Come, let the righteous dance,
Rejoice before your God,
Be happy and joyful.
Give him your praise.
We give you our praise.
Shout for joy to God
Who rides upon the clouds;
How awesome are His deeds,
So great is His power.
Give him your praise.
We give you our praise.

He gives the desolate a home.
He leads the prisoners out with singing.
Father to the fatherless,
Defender of the widow,
Is God in His holy place.
