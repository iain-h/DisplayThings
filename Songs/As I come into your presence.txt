You are awesome in this place,
Mighty God.
You are awesome in this place,
Abba, Father.
You are worthy of all praise,
To you our hands we raise.
You are awesome in this place,
Mighty God.

As I come into your presence,
Past the gates of praise,
Into your sanctuary
Till we're standing face to face,
I look upon your countenance,
I see the fullness of your grace,
And I can only bow down and say:
