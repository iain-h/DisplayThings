The grace of God upon my life
Is not dependent upon me,
On what I have done
Or deserved,
But a gift of mercy from God
Which has been given unto me
Because of His love,
His love for me.
It is unending, unfailing,
Unlimited, unmerited,
The grace of God given unto me.
It is unending, unfailing,
Unlimited, unmerited,
The grace of God given unto me.
