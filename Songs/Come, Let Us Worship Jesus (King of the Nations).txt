Jesus, King of the nations,
Jesus, Lord of all.
Jesus, King of the nations,
Lord of all.
#1
Come, let us worship Jesus,
King of nations, Lord of all.
Magnificent and glorious,
Just and merciful.
#2
Lavish our hearts' affection,
Deepest love and highest praise.
Voice, race and language blending,
All the world amazed.
#3
Bring tributes from the nations,
Come in joyful cavalcades,
One thunderous acclamation,
One banner raised.
#4
Come, Lord, and fill Your temple,
Glorify Your dwelling place,
Till nations see Your splendour
And seek Your face.
#5
Fear God and give Him glory,
For His hour of judgement comes.
Creator, Lord Almighty,
Worship Him alone.
