#C
Lord, reign in me,
Reign in Your power;
Over all my dreams,
In my darkest hour.
You are the Lord of all I am,
So won't You reign in me again?
#1
Over All The Earth,
You reign on high,
Every mountain stream,
Every sunset sky.
But my one request,
Lord, my only aim
Is that You'd reign in me again.
#2
Over every thought,
Over every word,
May my life reflect the beauty of my Lord;
'Cause You mean more to me
Than any earthly thing,
So won't You reign in me again?
