All the glory, honour and pow'r
Belong to you, belong to you.
Jesus, Saviour, anointed One,
I worship you, I worship you.
#1
My heart is full of admiration
For you, my Lord, my God and King.
Your excellence, my inspiration,
Your words of grace have made my spirit sing.
#2
You love what's right and hate what's evil,
Therefore your God sets you on high,
And on your head pours oil of gladness,
While fragrance fills your royal palaces.
#3
Your throne, O God, will last for ever,
Justice will be your royal decree.
In majesty, ride out victorious,
For righteousness, truth and humility.
