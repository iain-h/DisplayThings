The Lord is our strength,
The Lord is our song,
With joy we draw
From the wells of salvation today.
(Repeat)
#2
So let's sing to the Lord,
He's done glorious things,
Let's shout aloud and dance for joy
For great is the Holy One.
So let's sing to the Lord,
He's done glorious things,
Let's rejoice in our God
For the things he has done.
#3
We give thanks to you, Lord,
And call on your name;
We proclaim that your name is exalted on high.
(Repeat)
#4
So we sing to you, Lord,
You've done glorious things,
We shout aloud and dance for joy
For great is the Holy One.
So we sing to you, Lord,
You've done glorious things,
We rejoice in our God
For the things you have done.
