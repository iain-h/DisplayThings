Revival! we're praying for revival,
That Your kingdom may come,
Your will may be done
Throughout this land.
(Repeat)
#1
Send now Your Spirit, Lord, may He come;
Cause us to glorify Jesus Your Son,
That all in this nation might know
He is the Lord.
#2
Send now Your Spirit, let truth arise;
Where darkness has blinded, open closed eyes,
Bring spiritual health to this nation
As we cry to You:
#3
Come heal our land.
Come heal our land.
Come heal our land.
Come heal our land.
