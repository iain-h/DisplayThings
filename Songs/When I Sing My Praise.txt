When I worship You,
Heaven comes to me,
Heaven comes to me.
When I worship You,
Heaven comes to me,
Heaven comes to me.
#1
When I Sing My Praise to You,
I am lifted up to higher ground.
Something happens in my soul
When I lift my voice to worship You.
Feels like sunshine on my face,
A cool breeze in a desert place.
#2
Heaven is where I belong,
Where the angels sing before Your throne.
I am caught up in their sound,
When I lift my voice to worship You.
From beyond where eyes can see,
Love is pouring over me.
