I just want to have a pure heart,
I just want to have a pure, pure heart.
I just want to have a pure heart,
I just want to have a pure, pure heart.
#1
Create In Me the purest of hearts,
According to Your unfailing love.
Renew a steadfast spirit within
And wash away my sin.
And make me like the snow,
But even whiter still.
#2
I'm clay within the Potter's hand
Where tenderness meets discipline.
I need it all, Lord, come and form
Your holiness in me.
And make me like the snow,
But even whiter still.
