#1
Tell out, my soul,
The greatness of the Lord:
Unnumbered blessings
Give my spirit voice;
Tender to me
The promise of His word;
In God my Saviour
Shall my heart rejoice.
#2
Tell out, my soul,
The greatness of His name:
Make known His might,
The deeds His arm has done;
His mercy sure,
From age to age the same;
His holy name:
The Lord, the Mighty One.
#3
Tell out, my soul,
The greatness of His might:
Pow'rs and dominions
Lay their glory by;
Proud hearts and stubborn wills
Are put to flight,
The hungry fed,
The humble lifted high.
#4
Tell out, my soul,
The glories of His word:
Firm is His promise,
And His mercy sure.
Tell out, my soul,
The greatness of the Lord
To children's children
And for evermore.
