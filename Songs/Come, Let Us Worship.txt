(For) You are God,
And You're worthy to be praised,
And You are good,
For Your love will never end:
The great I Am,
You are faithful in all of Your ways.
(Repeat)
#1
Come, let us worship the King of kings,
The Creator of all things.
Let your soul arise to Him,
Come and bless the Lord our King.
#2
Lord, my heart and voice I raise,
To praise Your wondrous ways,
And with confidence I come
To approach Your heavenly throne.
#3
Come and fill this place with Your glory,
Come and captivate our gaze;
Come and fill us with Your fire,
That the world might know Your name.
