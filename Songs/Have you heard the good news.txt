Have You heard the good news?
Have you heard the good news?
We can live in hope
Because of what the Lord has done.
(Repeat)
#1
There is a way
When there seems to be no way,
There is a light in the darkness:
There is a hope,
An everlasting hope,
There is a God who can help us.
#2
A hope for justice
And a hope for peace,
A hope for those in desperation:
We have a future,
If only we believe
He works in every situation.
