King of kings, Lord of lords,
Lion of Judah, Word of God.
King of kings, Lord of lords,
Lion of Judah, Word of God.
Word of God.
And here he comes,
The King of glory comes!
In righteousness he comes to judge the earth.
And here he comes,
The King of glory comes!
With justice he'll rule the earth.

(Shout)
Almighty God, you are the Rock;
All your works are perfect,
And all your ways are just.
You are a faithful God who does no wrong.
Yet we your people,
Both church and nation,
Are covered with shame
Because of our unfaithfulness to you.
We have sinned so seriously against you,
And against one another û
Therefore the foundations of our society crumble.
Have mercy, Lord,
Forgive us, Lord,
Restore us, Lord,
Revive your church again;
Let justice flow
Like rivers,
And righteousness like a never-failing stream.
