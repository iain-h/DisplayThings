Oi, Oi, We Are Gonna Praise The Lord.
Oi, oi, we are gonna praise the Lord.
Oi, oi, we are gonna praise the Lord.
He's an exciting, powerising, c-colossal,
Humungous-mungous God!

But it's sometimes hard to understand
That the God who made the earth and man
Would point a finger down from heaven and shout:
'Hey you! I love you.
Hey you! I love you.
Hey you, you!
I love you', but it's true!
