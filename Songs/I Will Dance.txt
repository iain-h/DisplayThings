I will dance, I will sing,
To be mad for my King.
Nothing, Lord, is hindering
The passion in my soul.
(Repeat)
#2
And I'll become
Even more undignified than this.
(Some would say it's foolishness but)
I'll become
Even more undignified than this.

Na, na, na, na, na, na! Hey!
Na, na, na, na, na, na! Hey!
