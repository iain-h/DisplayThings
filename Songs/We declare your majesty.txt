We declare your majesty,
We proclaim that your name is exalted;
For you reign magnificently,
Rule victoriously
And your pow'r is shown throughout the earth.
And we exclaim our God is mighty,
Lift up your name, for you are holy.
Sing it again, all honour and glory,
In adoration we bow before your throne.
