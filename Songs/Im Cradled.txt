#C
I'm Cradled,
Cradled in the arms of love.
Yes, I'm cradled,
Cradled in the arms of love.
#1
My struggles for approval
Were never meant to be.
To know that I'm accepted
Is Your desire for me.
Because...
#2
My fears about the future,
All my anxieties,
Are calmed when I surrender
To the One who's holding me.
