God is good all the time!
He put a song of praise in this heart of mine;
God is good all the time!
Through the darkest night
His light will shine:
God is good, God is good all the time.
#1
If you're walking
Through the valley
And there are shadows all around,
Do not fear,
He will guide you,
He will keep you safe and sound
'cause he has promised
To never leave you
Nor forsake you,
And His word is true.
#2
We were sinners,
So unworthy,
Still for us he chose to die:
Filled us with
His Holy Spirit,
Now we can stand and testify
That His love
Is everlasting
And His mercies
They will never end.
#3
Though I may not understand
All the plans you have for me,
My life is in your hands,
And through the eyes of faith
I can clearly see:
