I will bless the Lord at all times,
I will bless the Lord at all times.
In every situation I will give You praise,
I will rejoice in You always.
(Repeat)
#1
You've Placed A Song Within My Heart,
And this song will bless You,
Your praise is always on my lips.
Whatever life may bring,
I know that You are God;
So I can trust in You and sing.
#2
Immanuel, God with us,
Immanuel, You are near.
Immanuel, my God is for me,
My God is for me.
So...
