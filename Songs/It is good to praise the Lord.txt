It is good to praise the Lord
And make music to Your name O God most high
To proclaim Your love and faithfulness
All the day and through the night
#2
You make me glad by Your deeds O Lord
So I sing for joy at all Your hands have made
How great are Your works O Lord
Elohim Baruch Hashem
(Bless the name of the Lord)

May I dwell in Your courts O Lord
There to flourish like the trees of Lebonon
Planted in the house of Adonai
There to live forevermore
