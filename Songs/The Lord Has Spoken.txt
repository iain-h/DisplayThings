The Lord has spoken. (men/women echo)
His purpose stands. (Men/Women echo)
The Lord has spoken. (Men/Women echo)
His purpose stands. (Men/Women echo)
Does God speak and then not act?
Make a vow and not fulfil?
I will choose to serve the Lord
Wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly.
#2
Oh, raise up a church
With a different spirit,
Like Caleb's spirit, believing Your word.
Oh, raise up a church who will not sin,
They press on in to possess the land.
#3
You began with just one man,
A covenant with Abraham,
Promising that through his seed
The nations would be blessed,
And now Your plan is manifest.
#4
Oh, raise up a church
With a different spirit,
Like Caleb's spirit, believing Your word.
Oh, raise up a church who will not sin,
They press on in to possess the land.
Oh, raise up a church who walk by faith,
In the fear of God they overcome.
Oh, raise up a church
Whose God is with them,
They walk in wisdom, they fear no harm.
#5
Deliver us from the fear of man,
And by Your grace we shall stand.
We'll call to mind Your mighty works
And Your acts of sovereign power;
We'll gather strength as we agree
The battle belongs to the Lord.

Oh, raise up a church
With a different spirit,
Like Caleb's spirit, believing Your word.
Oh, raise up a church who will not sin,
They press on in to possess the land.
Oh, raise up a church who walk by faith,
In the fear of God they overcome.
Oh, raise up a church
Whose God is with them,
They walk in wisdom, they fear no harm.
Oh, raise up a church
Who revere Your judgements,
They lift up a banner of mercy and love.
Oh, raise up a church
Who'll not keep silent,
They speak of the glory of Your dear Son.
