Joy is the food we share;
Love is our home, brothers.
Praise God for the body;
Shalom, Shalom.
#1
Praise God for the body,
Praise God for the Son;
Praise God for the life
That binds our hearts in one.
#2
Guard your circle, brothers,
Clasp your hand in hand;
Satan cannot break
The bond in which we stand.
#3
Shed your extra clothing,
Keep your baggage light;
Rough will be the battle,
Long will be the fight, but...
#4
Praise God for the body,
Praise God for the Son;
Praise God for the life
That binds our hearts in one.
