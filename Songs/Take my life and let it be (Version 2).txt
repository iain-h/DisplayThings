#1
Take my life, and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to thee;
Take my hands, and let them move
At the impulse of thy love,
At the impulse of thy love.
#2
Take my feet, and let them be
Swift and beautiful for thee.
Take my voice, and let me sing
Always, only, for my King,
Always, only, for my King.
#3
Take my lips, and let them be
Filled with messages from thee.
Take my silver and my gold,
Not a mite would I withhold,
Not a mite would I withhold.
#4
Take my love; my God I pour
At thy feet its treasure-store.
Take myself, and I will be
Ever, only, all for thee,
Ever, only, all for thee.
#5
Take my life, and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to thee.
Take myself, and I will be
Ever, only, all for thee,
Ever, only, all for thee.
