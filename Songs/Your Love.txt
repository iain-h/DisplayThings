Pour over me,
Pour over me,
Let Your rain flood this thirsty soul.
Pour over me Your waves of love,
Pour over me.
#1
Your Love, shining like the sun,
Pouring like the rain,
Raging like the storm,
Refreshing me again.
I receive Your love.
#2
Your grace frees me from the past,
It purges every sin,
It purifies my heart
And heals me from within.
I receive Your grace.
#3
I come and lay my burden down
Gladly at Your feet,
I'm opening up my heart;
Come make this joy complete.
I receive Your peace.
