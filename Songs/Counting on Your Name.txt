I'm counting on Your Name
I'm counting on Your Name
Counting on Your Name to save me
I'm trusting You're the way
I'm trusting You're the way
Trusting You're the way my Saviour
#1
My name is written on Your hands
You've called me Your own
You've called me Your own
Now I am Yours no earthly power
Could tear us apart
Tear us apart
#2
My life is built on nothing less
than Your faithfulness
Your faithfulness
Counting on Christ and Christ alone
I'm hoping in You
Hoping in You
