So lead me, oh lead me into Your arms;
I will be safe in the shadow of Your wing.
Lead me, oh lead me into Your arms;
I will be safe in Almighty.

We have flooded the altar with our tears;
We have wearied You, Lord, with our words.
Great God, our promises we've broken,
O Lord, forgive me.
#2
You are breaking the pride in our hearts;
You have given us tears for the lost.
You crown the humble with salvation;
O Lord, humble me.
#3
You have paid back our sin with Your love;
Lover's arms You have offered us.
Faithful One, raise up a faithful people
Who find their treasure here.
