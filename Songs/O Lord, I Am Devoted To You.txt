Jesus, may my devotion be pleasing,
Expressed through this song I am singing,
Pouring my heart out to You, only You.
You are the reason for living, I'm breathing:
My refuge, my strength and my healing,
So I give my heart unto You,
Only You.
#1
O Lord, I Am Devoted To You,
All that I am I give You,
Nothing do I withhold.
I am nothing without You,
All my hope is upon You,
Simply telling You I am Yours,
I am Yours.
#2
Every earthly distraction
Fades away to the background,
I'm content just to be with You.
Jesus, You satisfy my longing,
To You do I cry, I'm coming,
Kneeling before Your throne,
At Your throne.
