#1
River, wash over me,
Cleanse me and make me new.
Bathe me, refresh me and fill me anew.
River, wash over me.
#2
Spirit, watch over me,
Lead me to Jesus' feet.
Cause me to worship and fill me anew.
Spirit, watch over me.
#3
Jesus, rule over me,
Reign over all my heart.
Teach me to praise you and fill me anew.
Jesus, rule over me.
