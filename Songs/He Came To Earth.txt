#C
King of kings and Lord of lords,
I lift my voice in praise;
Such amazing love, but I do believe
This King has died for me.
#1
He came to earth, not to be served,
But gave His life to be a ransom for many;
The Son of God, the Son of man,
He shared our pain and bore our sins in His body.
#2
And so I stand, a broken soul,
To see the pain that I have brought to Jesus;
And yet each heart will be consoled,
To be made new, the joy of all believers.
#3
And from now on, through all my days,
I vow to live each moment here for Jesus;
Not looking back, but giving praise
For all my Lord has done for this believer.
