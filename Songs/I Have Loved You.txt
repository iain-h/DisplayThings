(and) I have loved You with an everlasting love,
And I have drawn you with My loving kindness.
And I have loved you with an everlasting love,
And I have drawn you with My loving kindness.
#1
Because God loved You and to keep His own,
He brought you out with a mighty hand,
He redeemed you from the devil's yoke.
Oh, the Lord, He is the God
And faithful is He.
He'll keep His word and His covenant,
Giving mercy and prosperity.
#2
And casting all of Your cares on Him
For He cares for you,
There's a love dimension
In the kingdom of God,
It's sure to take you through.
God commanded His love toward us,
Christ died on a tree,
Then He rose again, the living God,
More than conquerors now are we.
