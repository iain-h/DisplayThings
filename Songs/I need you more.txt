I need you more,
More than yesterday,
I need you more,
More than words can say.
I need you more
Than ever before,
I need you, Lord,
I need you, Lord.
#1
More than the air I breathe,
More than the song I sing,
More than the next heartbeat,
More than anything.
And, Lord, as time goes by,
I'll be by your side
'cause I never want to go
Back to my old life.
#2
Right here in your presence
Is where I belong;
This old broken heart
Has finally found a home
And I'll never be alone.
