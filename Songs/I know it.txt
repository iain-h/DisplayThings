#1
I know it, I know it,
His blood has set me free,
I've been delivered, forgiven,
Fear has got no hold on me.
I'm set apart,
Not living life my own way,
No holding back
Till I see him face to face
Because I know it,
Oh yes, I know it,
I know it,
The blood of Jesus has set me free!
#2
There is healing in the name of Jesus,
Salvation in the name of Jesus,
Forgiveness in the name of Jesus.
I've never known it like I know it today;
There is power in the name of Jesus,
Fullness of joy I've found in Jesus,
Strength in the name of Jesus.
I know it, I know it,
Oh, I've got to tell you that
I know it . . .
