See, your Saviour comes;
See, your Saviour comes.
#1
Desolate cities, desolate homes,
Desolate lives on the streets,
Angry and restless. When will you know
The things that would make for your peace?
#2
Father of mercy, hear as we cry
For all who live in this place;
Show here your glory, come satisfy
Your longing that all should be saved.
#3
Where lives are broken, let there be hope,
Where there's division bring peace;
Where there's oppression, judge and reprove,
And rescue the crushed and the weak.
#4
Lord, let your glory dwell in this land,
In mercy restore us again:
Pour out salvation, grant us your peace,
And strengthen the things that remain.
