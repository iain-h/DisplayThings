Come, Spirit, come.
Come, holy wind,
Blow through the temple of my life.
O come, Spirit, come,
All-pow'rful wind,
All-loving breeze and breath of life.
Breathe upon me, breathe upon me, 	Spirit.
Breathe upon me, blow, O wind of Spirit.
Breathe upon me, blow, O wind of God.
#2
Come, Spirit, come.
Come, holy rain,
Fall on the dry ground of my life.
O come, Spirit, come,
O mighty flood,
O loving stream and source of life.
Flow over me, flow over me, Spirit.
Flow over me, flow over me, Spirit.
Flow over me, flow, O rain of God.
#3
Come, Spirit, come.
Come, holy fire,
Consume the offering of my life.
O come, Spirit, come,
O blazing fire,
O burning love and flame of life.
Burn in my heart, burn in my heart, Spirit.
Burn in my heart, burn in my heart, Spirit.
Burn in my heart, burn, O fire of God.
