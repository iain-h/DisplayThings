Rejoice rejoice rejoice rejoice
O lift your voice and sing
And open up your heart to welcome Him.
Rejoice Rejoice Rejoice Rejoice
And welcome now your king
For Christ the Lord is born in Bethlehem
#1
O come and join the dance that all began so long ago
When Christ the Lord was born in Bethlehem
Through all the years of darkness still the dance goes on and on
O take my hand and come and join the song
#2
Come shed your heavy load
And dance your worries all away
For Christ the Lord is born in Bethlehem
He came to break the power of sin
And turn your night to day
O take my hand and come and join the song.
#3
(Instrumental verse)
#4
Let laughter ring and angels sing
And joy be all around
For Christ the Lord is born in Bethlehem
And if you seek with all your heart
He surely can be found
O take my hand and come and join the song.
#5
Rejoice Rejoice Rejoice Rejoice
O lift your voice and sing
And open up your heart to welcome Him:
Rejoice Rejoice Rejoice Rejoice
And welcome now your king
For Christ the Lord is born in Bethlehem
For Christ the Lord is born in Bethlehem
For Christ the Lord is born in Bethlehem.
