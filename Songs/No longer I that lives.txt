It's no longer I that lives but Jesus lives in me
He gave me life that lasts eternally
And now this mighty pow'r that raised him from the dead
Is in me is in me
Is in me is in me
Is in me is in me
Is in me is in me
#1
Since he came into my life I'm not alone 
He is always here I'm never on my own
Only he can know my heart from deep within
When I lose my life that's when my life begins
#2
He healed the sick restored the blind and raised the lame
And in his word it says that I can do the same
The Holy Spirit in him made the blind to see
And that same spirit now can do the same through me
