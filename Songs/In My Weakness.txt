You are the Lord, You never change,
You still the storm when I call Your name.
You're all I want, You're always there,
No matter when, no matter where.
You're the Lord, You never change.
You're the Lord, You never change.
#1
In my weakness You are strong,
When I fall short You carry me along.
Into my darkness You shine Your light,
When I feel blinded, You restore my sight.
#2
I'm inconsistent, but You are true;
I don't trust myself, but I depend on You.
Look through my selfishness, and see my heart;
Bring out the precious from the worthless parts.
#3
I need courage, Lord, to make a change;
It's time my independence got rearranged.
I'm tired of chasing after my own ways;
So I'll serve You, Lord,
Serve You, Lord, serve You, Lord,
For the rest, rest of my days.
