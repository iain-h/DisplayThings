It's a wonderful feeling to
Know you're saved.
It's a wonderful, wonderful,
Wonderful WONDERFUL!
Wonderful feeling to
Know you're saved.

It's a wonderful, wonderful,
Wonderful feeling,

My life is built on rock, not sand;
It's a wonderful feeling to know you're saved.
And none can steal me from God's hand;
It's a wonderful feeling to know you're saved.
#3
I once was lost but now I'm found:
It's a wonderful feeling to know you're saved.
In Father's arms I'm safe and sound:
It's a wonderful feeling to know you're saved.
#4
My old life's gone, I'm now brand new:
It's a wonderful feeling to know you're saved.
Much less of me, much more of You:
It's a wonderful feeling to know you're saved.
