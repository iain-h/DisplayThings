#C
I'm living for this cause,
I lay down my life
Into Your hands.
I'm living for the truth,
The hope of the world,
In You I'll stand.
All I want is You.
#1
Hope Has Found Its Home Within Me,
Now that I've been found in You.
Let all I am be all You want me to be,
'Cause all I want is more of You,
All I want is more of You.
#2
Let Your presence fall upon us,
I want to see You face to face;
Let me live forever lost in Your love,
'Cause all I want is more of You,
All I want is more of You.
#3
All I want is,
All I want is You, Jesus.
