And I will walk with You,
Another footstep now.
Can we walk on again,
Another footstep now?
I've walked in fields of pain,
I've sheltered in Your love;
In the valley of death's shadow,
I will fear no evil,
For You are here with me.
My comfort be, my comfort be.
#1
Draw Me Near To You;
Can I come so close
That I can hear Your song of love
That heals my broken heart?
#2
Draw me near to You,
Even closer still,
So I can see Your scars of love
That saved my wounded soul.
