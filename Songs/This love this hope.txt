Now is the time to worship you,
Now is the time to offer you
All of my thoughts, my dreams and plans;
I lay it down.
Now is the time to live for you,
Now is the time I'm found in you,
Now is the time your kingdom comes.

This love, this hope,
This peace of God, this righteousness,
This faith, this joy,
This life, complete in me.
Now healed and whole
And risen in His righteousness;
I live in him, he lives in me.
And filled with this hope in God,
Reflecting His glory.
