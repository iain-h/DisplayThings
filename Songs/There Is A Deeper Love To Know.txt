Everybody sing, everybody shout,
For the joy of the Lord
Is our strength forever.
Hey, everybody sing, everybody shout,
For the joy of the Lord is our strength.

There Is A Deeper Love To Know,
There is a higher place where we can go.
There is a freedom at the cross,
There is a light that shines for all the world.
#2
And I can't hold this joy inside,
I'm jumping in Your arms of mercy.
#3
There is a brighter day to come,
When all the world will bow down to Your Son.
And all the broken will rejoice,
Even the kings will say, 'You are the Lord'.
#4
And we can't hold this joy inside,
We're dancing in Your arms of mercy.
