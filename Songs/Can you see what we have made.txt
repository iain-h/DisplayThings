Candlelight, burning bright,
Chase the darkness of the night.
Christ the light, light our way,
Live inside our hearts today.
#1
Can you see what we have made
For this very special day?
An orange for our planet home,
Circling around the sun.
#2
Count the seasons as we sing,
Summer, autumn, winter, spring.
Sing to God who sends the rain,
Making all things new again.
#3
See the food with colours bright,
Tastebuds tingle at the sight.
Let's be thankful as we share,
God's good gifts are everywhere.
#4
Why then is the world we made,
Wrapped around with ribbon red?
Red is for the ransom paid,
When our Lord was crucified.
#5
There's a world I'm dreaming of,
Where there's peace and joy and love.
Light of Jesus everywhere,
This is my Christingle prayer.
