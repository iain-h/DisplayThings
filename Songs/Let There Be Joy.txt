Let There Be Joy, let there be peace,
Let there be power, let there be praise.
Let there be joy, joy in the Holy Ghost.
It was for freedom that we were set free,
Let every mountain be cast to the sea.
Let there be joy, joy in the Holy Ghost.

We will declare it to the heavens,
The righteousness of God in which we stand.
We will proclaim it to the nations;
Every eye shall see, every ear shall hear,
Every heart will understand.
