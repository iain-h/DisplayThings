Oh, I will sing of the Lamb.
Oh, I will sing of the Lamb.
My heart fills with wonder,
My mouth fills with praise!
Hallelujah, hallelujah.
#1
I will sing of the Lamb,
Of the price that was paid for me,
Purchased by God,
Giving all He could give!
Here now I stand
In the garments of righteousness;
Death has no hold, for in Jesus I live.
#2
I will sing of His blood
That flows for my wretchedness,
Wounds that are bared,
That I may be healed;
Power and compassion,
The marks of His ministry:
May they be mine as I harvest His field.
#3
Once I was blind,
Yet believed I saw everything,
Proud in my ways,
Yet a fool in my part;
Lost and alone
In the company of multitudes,
Life in my body, yet death in my heart.
#4
Oh, I will sing of the Lamb.
Oh, I will sing of the Lamb.
Oh, why should the King
Save a sinner like me?
Hallelujah, hallelujah.
#5
What shall I give
To the Man who gave everything,
Humbling Himself
Before all He had made?
Dare I withold
My own life from His sovereignty?
I shall give all for the sake of His name!
#6
Oh, I will sing of the Lamb.
Oh, I will sing of the Lamb.
I'll sing of His love
For the rest of my days!
Hallelujah, hallelujah.
