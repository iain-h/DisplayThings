#C
Let the angels sing of the Lord's great love,
Well, it's shining down like the heavens above.
Let the nations bow to the living God
And know Your truth,
I believe in You.
#1
I Believe in everything You do,
All You have to say.
I've come to realise You're the only way,
Oh, I believe in You.
#2
I've received something in my life
Greater than before:
Your truth has set me free and I love You, Lord,
Oh, I believe in You.
#3
I believe, I believe,
I believe, I believe in You.
(Repeat)
