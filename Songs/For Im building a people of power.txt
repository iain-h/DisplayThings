#1
For I'm building a people of power
And I'm making a people of praise,
That will move through this land by my Spirit,
And will glorify my precious name.
Build your church, Lord,
Make us strong, Lord,
Join our hearts, Lord,
Through your Son.
Make us one, Lord, in your body,
In the kingdom of your Son.
