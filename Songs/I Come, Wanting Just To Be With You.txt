#1
I Come, Wanting Just To Be With You;
Today let me hear Your voice.
I come, wanting just to give to You,
To say, You are everything.
#2
Don't ever let my heart grow cold,
Don't ever let me lose sight of Your truth.
Draw near that I may drink from eternal water.
#3
You are the Fountain of all life,
You are the peace unto my soul.
You are the Way, the Truth, the Light;
Jesus, into Your arms I run.
You are the holy Son of God,
You gave up Your life to save my soul.
You have redeemed me through the cross;
Jesus, with thankfulness I come.
