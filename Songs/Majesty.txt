Majesty, worship His majesty,
Unto Jesus be glory, honour and praise.
Majesty, kingdom authority
Flows from His throne unto His own,
His anthem raise.
So exalt, lift up on high the name of  Jesus;
Magnify, come glorify Christ Jesus the King.
Majesty, worship His majesty,
Jesus who died, now glorified,
King of all kings.
