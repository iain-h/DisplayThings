I exalt you, Jesus, my sacrifice,
I exalt you, my Redeemer and my Lord.
I exalt you, worthy Lamb of God,
And in honour I bow down
Before your throne.
#1
Lamb of God, Holy One,
Jesus Christ, Son of God,
Lifted up willingly to die;
That I the guilty one may know
The blood once shed still freely flowing,
Still cleansing, still healing.
