I worship You,
I love You:
All that I am
Sings this song of praise.
#1
Who Can Compare with You, my Father;
Loving and kind, faithful and true?
When You forgive my heart that is broken,
I gratefully sing my love to You.
#2
Here I will dwell in the arms of my Father,
Knowing Your grace, hearing Your voice;
Trusting Your word, feeling Your peace,
Resting in You and in Your love.
#3
And I abide in You,
I abide with You.
