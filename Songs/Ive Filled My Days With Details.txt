#C
To be still and know You are God,
To be still and know You are God,
Just to rest in Your arms.
#1
I've Filled My Days With Details
And all the choices of the earth,
Carried the yoke of worry,
And all the burdens that it brings.
And through the midst of all the rushing,
You whisper to our hearts,
And with Your sweet voice
You say to us:
#2
So give me peace and wisdom
To know how to fill my time,
Where I can learn to keep You
At the centre of my life.
So through the midst of all the rushing
There is time to spend with You,
And my foundation
Will daily be:
