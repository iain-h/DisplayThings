#C
Shout to the north and the south,
Sing to the east and the west.
Jesus is Saviour to all,
Lord of heaven and earth.
#1
Men of faith, rise up and sing
Of the great and glorious King.
You are strong when you feel weak,
In your brokenness complete.
#2
Rise up, women of the truth,
Stand and sing to broken hearts.
Who can know the healing pow'r
Of our awesome King of love.
#3
We've been through fire,
We've been through rain,
We've been refined by the pow'r of His name.
We've fallen deeper in love with you,
You've burned the truth on our lips.
#4
Rise up, church with broken wings,
Fill this place with songs again
Of our God who reigns on high,
By His grace again we'll fly.
