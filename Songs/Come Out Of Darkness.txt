Come out of darkness into the light;
Come out of darkness into the light.
Come out of darkness into the arms of love,
Into the arms of love.
#1
To a world in darkness,
To a world in pain,
At this time You've called us,
Your love to proclaim;
Through Your willing people
To the nations say,
To the nations say:
#2
Do not be discouraged,
See what God has done;
He is working through us,
This world shall be won.
There will be a harvest
When the nations hear.
What are they going to hear?
#3
By the blood of Jesus sin is washed away;
All who call upon Him, He will surely save.
This will be the promise that the nations hear,
When we sing it loud and clear.
