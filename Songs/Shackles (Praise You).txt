#C
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise you
Just wanna praise you
You broke the chains
Now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise you
I'm gonna praise you
#1
In the corners of my mind
I just can't seem to find
A reason to believe that I can break free
'Cause you see I have been
Bound for so long
Feels like all hope is gone
But as I lift my hands I understand
That I should praise you through my circumstance
