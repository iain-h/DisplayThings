I'm in love with a King,
I'm in love with a Friend,
And whatever I do
This love never ends.
He's for me, He pleads for me,
Pours out His life for me;
What more do I need?
Amazing love!
#1
Love Is Patient, love is kind,
It does not envy or speak in pride.
It does not seek its own reward:
Oh, that's how You love me, Lord.
#2
It always hopes and perseveres,
It covers over a wealth of sins,
It shuns all evil, delights in truth:
Oh, I want to be like You.
#3
There are tongues now, but they will cease;
There is knowledge - it's incomplete.
For what we know now, we know in part,
But what endures is a loving heart.
