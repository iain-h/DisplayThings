#1
I'm Forever In Your Love,
I'm forever saved by grace.
You have chosen me
And crowned me with Your love.
I'll forever trust in You,
I'll forever say You're good.
You are King of kings
And I will worship You.
#2
La la la la la la,
Just want to thank You,
La la la la la la,
Just want to praise You,
La la la la la la,
That I can live like this forever.
(Repeat)
