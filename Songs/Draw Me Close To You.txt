#1
Draw Me Close To You,
Never let me go.
I lay it all down again,
To hear You say that I'm Your friend.
You are my desire,
No one else will do,
'Cause nothing else could take Your place,
To feel the warmth of Your embrace.
Help me find the way,
Bring me back to You.
#2
You're all I want,
You're all I've ever needed.
You're all I want,
Help me know You are near.
