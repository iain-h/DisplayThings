Shine, Jesus, shine,
Fill this land with the Father's glory;
Blaze, Spirit, blaze,
Set our hearts on fire.
Flow, river, flow,
Flood the nations with grace and mercy;
Send forth your word, Lord,
And let there be light.
#1
Lord, the light of your love is shining,
In the midst of the darkness, shining;
Jesus, Light of the World, shine upon us,
Set us free by the truth you now bring us.
Shine on me, shine on me.
#2
Lord, I come to your awesome presence,
From the shadows into your radiance;
By the blood I may enter your brightness,
Search me, try me, consume all my darkness.
Shine on me, shine on me.
#3
As we gaze on your kingly brightness,
So our faces display your likeness,
Ever changing from glory to glory;
Mirrored here may our lives tell your story.
Shine on me, shine on me.
