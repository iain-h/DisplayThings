With You, it all seems so right.
If the sun don't shine,
There's light in Your eyes.
With You, when mountains fall,
I stand on the Rock
And I am safe in Your arms
When I'm with You,
When I'm with You.
(Last time)
Just to be with You.
#1
Jesus, My Desire,
I turn towards Your ways.
Hungry for Your truth,
I'm here to seek Your face.
#2
But in my weakness I cry out to You, only You,
To be my strength when I am weak,
And do as You do.
#3
How can I stay pure?
Oh, how can I stay true?
By living out Your word
And dwelling in Your truth.
