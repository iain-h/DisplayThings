We ask You, O Lord,
For the rain of Your Spirit.
We ask You, O Lord,
For the rain of Your Spirit.
For now is the time,
For now is the time
Of the latter rain,
Of the latter rain.
#2
Send Your rain, cleanse us by Your word;
Let us be Your pure and radiant Bride.
Make us strong, prepare us for revival;
Let us see the nations turn their hearts,
Let us see the nations turn their hearts,
Let us see the nations turn their hearts
To You, to You.
#3
Send Your rain, mercy from heaven.
Send Your rain, the grace of Your Son.
Send Your rain, Word of Your power,
Send Your rain, come fill everyone.
(Repeat)
