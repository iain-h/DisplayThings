#C
You Are The One I Love,
You are the One that I adore.
(Repeat)
#1
For You've called me by name,
Drawn me close to Your heart,
Washed away all my shame with Your tears.
For the rest of my days,
I will offer my life
In thanksgiving and praise to my King.
#2
Now with You I will stay,
For Your word is my light,
And Your peace can allay all my fears;
And my victory song
Is the song of the cross,
You have won me love so divine.
#3
Such precious, precious love.
