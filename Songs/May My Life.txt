Teach me, Lord, to make my life as an offering,
To tell the world that Jesus Christ is King,
For the glory of God.
#1
May my life declare the honour of Your name,
Reveal the heart of Christ who came
To light the darkest place
With sacrificial love.
#2
Cause me, Lord, to reach out in the Father's name,
To glorify the Lamb once slain,
To light the darkest place
With sacrificial love.
