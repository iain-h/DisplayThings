(men) at the cross,
(Women) At the cross,
(All) He (You) died for my sin.
(Men) At the cross,
(Women) At the cross,
(All) He (You) gave us life again.

I know a place, a wonderful place,
Where accused and condemned
Find mercy and grace.
Where the wrongs we have done,
And the wrongs done to us
Were nailed there with Him (You)
There on the cross.
