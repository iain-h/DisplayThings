#1
How lovely is Thy dwelling place,
O Lord of hosts,
My soul longs and yearns for Your courts,
And my heart and flesh sing for joy
To the living God.
#2
One day in Your presence
Is far better to me than gold,
Or to live my whole life somewhere else;
And I would rather be
A doorkeeper in Your house
Than to take my fate upon myself.
#3
You are my sun and my shield,
You are my lover from the start,
And the highway to Your city
Runs through my heart.
