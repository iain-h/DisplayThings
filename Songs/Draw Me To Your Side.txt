When I cry out in passion,
To love You more than this,
Renew me in Your presence
And refresh me with Your kiss.
#1
Draw Me To Your Side, Lord,
Let me feel Your breath,
The very breath of life, Lord,
Rest my head upon Your chest.
And hold me in Your arms, Lord,
Wrap me in Your embrace,
Close enough that I can feel
Your breath upon my face.
#2
Far too long I've begged You
For Your sweet release,
To be lost in Your presence
And to know the taste of Your lips.
And for a heart like Yours, God,
And for the mind of Christ
To know no shame and no restraint
In my worship sacrifice.
#3
Well, the curse has been broken,
I know the curtain is torn in two,
No child, no man or woman
Need be separated from You.
The lonely and the broken,
Rejected and despised
Run through the gates of grace by faith,
Into the arms of Christ.
