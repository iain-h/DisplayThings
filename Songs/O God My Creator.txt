We come to the throne
Where flows the living stream,
And drink from the water,
And drink from the water,
And drink from the water that flows from Thee.
#1
O God my creator, create in me
That river of water that flows full and free.
Let it bring life to the dead and stagnant sea;
Spring up, O well, and flow on out of me.
#2
O God my Creator, create in me
That new way of living that flows full and free.
Let it bring life to the wilderness of man;
Spring up, O well, and flood this thirsty land.
