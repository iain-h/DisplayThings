#1
Be known to us in breaking bread,
But do not then depart;
Saviour, abide with us, and spread
Thy table in our heart.
#2
There sup with us in love divine;
Thy body and Thy blood,
That living bread, that heavenly wine,
Be our immortal food.
#3
We would not live by bread alone,
But by Thy word of grace,
In strength of which we travel on
To our abiding place.
