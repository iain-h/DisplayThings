Bless thou the Lord, O my soul,
Praise ye the Lord.
Bless thou the Lord, O my soul,
Praise ye the Lord.
Bless thou the Lord, O my soul,
Praise ye the Lord.
Bless thou the Lord, O my soul,
Praise ye the Lord.

I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live,
I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
My meditation of Him shall be sweet,
I will be glad, I will be glad in the Lord.
