All over the world,
All over the world,
Your Spirit is moving
All over the world.
#1
Your river is flowing,
Your presence has come,
Your Spirit is moving
All over the world.
You're touching the nations,
You're bringing us love,
Your Spirit is moving
All over the world.
You're touching the nations,
You're bringing us love,
Your Spirit is moving
All over the world.
#2
Your banner is lifted,
Your praises are sung,
Your Spirit is moving
All over the world.
Divisions are falling,
You're making us one,
Your Spirit is moving
All over the world.
Divisions are falling,
You're making us one,
Your Spirit is moving
All over the world.
