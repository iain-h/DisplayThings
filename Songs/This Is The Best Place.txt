We're worshipping the living God! (x4)
#1
This Is The Best Place,
This is the right place,
And we have confidence now to enter:
Let us draw near now,
With hearts sincere now,
In full assurance,
To worship Jesus.
#2
Let us consider,
For one another,
The way to love more,
As the day approaches.
Let us draw near now,
With hearts sincere now;
Let's meet together
To worship Jesus.
