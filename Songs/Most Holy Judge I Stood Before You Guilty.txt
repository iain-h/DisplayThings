Now I'm justified, You declare me righteous
Justified by the blood of the Lamb
Justified freely by Your mercy
By faith I stand and I'm justified.

Most Holy judge! I stood before You guilty
When You sent Jesus to the cross for my sin
There Your love was revealed
Your justice vindicated
One sacrifice has paid the cost for all who trust in Jesus.
#2
I come to You and I can call You father
There is no fear, there is no shame before You
For by Your gift of grace
Now I am one of Your children
An heir with those who bear Your name and share the hope of glory.
