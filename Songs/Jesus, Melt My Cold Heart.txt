Take me deeper,
Show me more.
It's all or nothing;
I give You everything, my Lord.
#1
Jesus, Melt My Cold Heart,
Break my stony emotions.
'Cause I've been playing with the waves
When I should be swimming in the ocean.
#2
Jesus, show Your mercy,
I'm so sorry for waiting;
I should be running to Your heart,
But I know I've been hesitating.
