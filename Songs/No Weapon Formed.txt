#1
No weapon formed, or army or King,
Shall be able to stand
Against the Lord and His anointed.
(Repeat)
#2
All principalities and powers
Shall crumble before the Lord;
And men's hearts shall be released,
And they shall come unto the Lord.
#3
No weapon formed, or army or King,
Shall be able to stand
Against the Lord and His anointed.
