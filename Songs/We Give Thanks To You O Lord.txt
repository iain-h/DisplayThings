Now Your salvation, Your power and Your kingdom
Have all come and you are Lord of all
The accuser of the brethren has been hurled down forever
Overcome by the blood, overcome by the blood
Overcome by the blood of the Lamb

We give thanks to You O Lord almighty God
The One who is , who was and is to come,
You've taken up your power and begun to reign
The nations bow before the Holy One
