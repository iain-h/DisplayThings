Praise, my soul, the King of heaven!
To His feet your tribute bring;
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
Who like me his praise should sing?
Praise him! Praise him!
Praise him! Praise him!
Praise the everlasting King!
#2
Praise him for His grace and favour
To our fathers in distress;
Praise him still the same as ever,
Slow to chide and swift to bless.
Praise him! Praise him!
Praise him! Praise him!
Glorious in His faithfulness.
#3
Father-like, he tends and spares us;
Well our feeble frame he knows;
In His hands he gently bears us,
Rescues us from all our foes.
Praise him! Praise him!
Praise him! Praise him!
Widely as His mercy flows.
#4
Angels, help us to adore him;
You behold him face to face;
Sun and moon, bow down before him,
Dwellers all in time and space.
Praise him! Praise him!
Praise him! Praise him!
Praise with us the God of grace!
