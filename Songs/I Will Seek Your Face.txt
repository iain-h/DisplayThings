I will seek Your face, O Lord;
I will seek Your face, O Lord.
I will seek Your face, O Lord;
I will seek Your face, O Lord.
#1
Lord, how awesome is Your presence;
Who can stand in Your light?
Those who by Your grace and mercy
Are made holy in Your sight.
#2
I will dwell in Your presence
All the days of my life;
There to gaze upon Your glory,
And to worship only You.
