#1
Almighty God, HOLY ONE,
Who can stand before You,
Who can come?
Perfect Lamb, who bore our sin,
Who deserves such mercy,
Gracious King?
#2
I come to Your throne of grace,
I'm standing in Christ,
I'm clothed in His righteousness.
To know Your presence,
To seek Your face.
Father, I delight in Your embrace.
