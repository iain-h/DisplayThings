So wake me, take me with You,
Chase me where Your river runs,
Romance me till my heart belongs to You.
Oh, draw me closer to You,
Lead me in Your ways,
Enchant me 'cause my life belongs to You.
#1
I Need You like the summer needs the sun.
I need You to walk and to run.
I need You like a river needs the rain.
I need You to fill me again.
Without You I run dry;
Without You I won't even survive.
#2
I need You like the stars need the sky.
I need You to help me to shine.
I need You like a singer needs a song.
I need You to carry on.
Without You I run dry,
Without You I won't even survive.
#3
Embrace me, let me feel Your strength,
Hide me in Your shade,
You're my shelter in the rain.
