I want to know You
I want to hear Your voice
I want to know You more
I want to touch you
I want to see your face
I want to know you more.
#1
In the secret, in a quiet place
In the stillness you are there.
In the secret, in the quiet hour
I wait only for you
'cause I want to know you more.
#2
I am reaching for the highest goal
That I may receive the prize
Pressing onward
Pushing every hindrance aside
Out of my way
'cos I want to know You more.
