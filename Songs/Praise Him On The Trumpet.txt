Hallelujah, praise the Lord,
Hallelujah, praise the Lord,
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.
Hallelujah, praise the Lord,
Hallelujah, praise the Lord,
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.

Praise him on the trumpet,
The psaltery and harp,
Praise Him on the timbrel and the dance,
Praise Him with stringed instruments, too.
Praise Him on the loud cymbals,
Praise Him on the loud cymbals,
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.
