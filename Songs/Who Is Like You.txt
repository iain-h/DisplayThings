Who Is Like You, Lord Almighty?
Crowned in splendour, robed in majesty,
Holy is Your name.
God of justice, rich in mercy.
Grace that flows from awesome glory,
The wonder of Your ways.
Mighty in power, perfect in sovereignty,
The revelation, You laid it aside for me
And bore human frame in Jesus.
#2
So I exalt You, God of glory,
And I will worship the Lord of eternity.
King of the nations, my wonderful Saviour,
God our Creator, my heavenly Father.
I worship only You.
