#C
Saving grace, washing over me;
Saving grace, that made a way for me:
I was lost until You rescued me,
Your grace covers me.
#1
I Am Amazed
By the power of Your grace,
I am amazed
That You took my sin and shame;
Restoring hope, restoring dignity:
Your grace covers me,
Your grace covers me, oh.
#2
I'm overwhelmed
By Your love and goodness,
I'm overwhelmed
That You took my brokenness:
Amazing love, how can this be?
Your grace covers me,
Your grace covers me.
