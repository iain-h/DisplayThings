And I thank You, Lord, for loving me,
And I lift my hands so gratefully.
And I thank You, Lord, that I can be
A child of Yours eternally.
#1
What Love Is This? The love of Jesus,
That gave its all, that cost His life.
Flesh torn by nails, life cruelly taken,
The Father's Son, love's sacrifice.
#2
You are my King, You are my Saviour,
You'll always be a friend to me.
Safe in Your arms now and forever
Your love shines bright, my morning star.
#3
Now let Your power rain down upon me;
Such peace and joy cascading down.
May Your love touch all those around me;
I'll shine for You, I'll shine for You.
