Lord of all creation,
Let this generation
See a visitation of Your power.
Lord of all creation,
There's an expectation
Rising in this nation every hour.
#1
Lord of all creation,
Let this generation
See a visitation of Your power;
Put to flight all the powers of darkness,
O come, Lord Jesus, come.
#2
Father God, forgive us,
Send Your cleansing rivers,
Wash us now and give us holy power;
Fill this land with Your awesome presence,
O come, Lord Jesus, come.
