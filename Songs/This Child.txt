This Child, heaven come down now
To be with us here,
Heavenly love and mercy appear,
Softly in awe and wonder come near û
To this heavenly Child.
#1
This Child, secretly comes in the night,
O this Child, hiding a heavenly light,
O this Child, coming to us like a stranger,
This heavenly Child.
#2
This Child, rising on us like the sun,
O this Child, given to light everyone,
O this Child, guiding our feet on the pathway
To peace on earth.
#3
This Child, raising the humble and poor,
O this Child, making the proud ones to fall;
O this child, filling the hungry with good things,
This heavenly Child.
