You are the Lord, the Saviour of all,
God of creation, we praise You.
We sing the songs that awaken thedawn,
God of creation, we praise You.
#1
Sing to the Lord with all of Your heart;
Sing of the glory that's due to His name.
Sing to the Lord with all of your soul,
Join all of heaven and earth to proclaim:
#2
Sing to the Lord with all of your mind,
With understanding give thanks to the King.
Sing to the Lord with all of your strength,
Living our lives as a praise offering.
