And the life that I now live,
No longer is my own,
Jesus lives in me, the hope of glory.
And each day I live,
No longer is my own,
Jesus lives in me, the hope of glory.
#1
There Is A Hope So Sure,
A promise so secure:
The mystery of God at last made known.
Treasures so vast appear,
All wisdom, knowledge here:
It's Christ in us, the hope of glory!
#2
There is a life so true,
A life of love so pure,
For all our sin a perfect sacrifice.
And when that life was nailed,
On cruel cross impaled,
Our sinful flesh with Him was crucified.
#3
There is a life so strong
That a whole world of wrong
And all the powers of hell could not defeat.
For Jesus rose again,
And if we died with Him,
With Him we'll rise to share His endless life.
