And You are God,
With fire in Your eyes,
And You are God,
Adorned in radiant light.
You are God
Whose hands were pierced for all:
What choice do I have,
But to give You my very all?
#1
I Will Come, come, come to the waters and drink;
I will praise, praise, praise Your name again.
I will rest, rest, rest, rest at Your feet,
For You have won my heart once again.
#2
I will thirst, thirst, thirst for all that You give;
And I will fall, fall, fall into Your arms again.
I will call, call, call to You alone each day,
For You have won my heart once again.
#3
I shall wait, wait, wait at the cross where we meet;
And I will live, live, live, by Your name I speak.
I will run, run, run for Your face to seek,
For You have won my heart once again.
