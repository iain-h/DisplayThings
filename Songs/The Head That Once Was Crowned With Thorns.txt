The head that once was crowned with thorns
Is crowned with glory now;
A royal diadem adorns
The mighty Victor's brow.
#2
The highest place that heaven affords
Is His by sovereign right,
The King of kings, the Lord of lords,
And heaven's eternal light.
#3
The joy of all who dwell above,
The joy of all below,
To whom He manifests His love,
And grants His name to know.
#4
To them the cross, with all its shame,
With all its grace, is given;
Their name an everlasting name,
Their joy the joy of heaven.
#5
They suffer with their Lord below,
They reign with Him above;
Their profit and their joy to know
The mystery of His love.
#6
The cross He bore is life and health,
Though shame and death to Him;
His people's hope, His people's wealth,
Their everlasting theme.
