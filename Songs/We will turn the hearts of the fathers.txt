We will turn the hearts of the fathers
So they will look again to their children.
We will turn the hearts of the children
So that together we can look to you.
(Repeat)
#1
The young and the old now,
Standing together,
Looking to Jesus to carry us through.
All different races, all different ages,
All of us here for your glory.
And we call on your Spirit,
Keep us together and pour in your power.
