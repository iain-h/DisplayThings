#1
Love came down at christmas,
Love all lovely, Love divine;
Love was born at Christmas,
Star and angels gave the sign.
#2
Worship we the Godhead,
Love Incarnate, Love divine;
Worship we our Jesus:
But wherewith for sacred sign?
#3
Love shall be our token,
Love be yours and love be mine,
Love to God and all men,
Love for plea and gift and sign.
