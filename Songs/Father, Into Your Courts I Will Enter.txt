All the earth will declare
That Your love is everywhere.
The fields will exalt, seas resound.
Hear the trees' joyful cry,
Praising You and so will I.
A new song I'll sing,
Lord, I will glorify and bless Your holy name.
#1
Father, Into Your Courts I Will Enter,
Maker of heaven and earth,
I tremble in Your holy presence.
Glory, glory in Your sanctuary,
Splendour and majesty, Lord, before You;
All life adores You.
