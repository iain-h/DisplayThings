I will dwell with You,
I will dwell with You.
I will dwell with You
In the Father and the Son.
#1
Give me life, Holy Spirit,
Guide my steps in Your sight;
Help me always give You pleasure,
Keep me walking in Your light.
Give me life, Holy Spirit,
Fill me now, make us one;
I will dwell with You forever,
In the Father and the Son.
