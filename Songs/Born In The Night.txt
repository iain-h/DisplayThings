#1
Born in the night, Mary's child,
A long way from Your home;
Coming in need, Mary's child,
Born in a borrowed room.
#2
Clear shining light, Mary's child,
Your face lights up our way:
Light of the world, Mary's child,
Dawn on our darkened day.
#3
Truth of our life, Mary's child,
You tell us God is good:
Prove it is true, Mary's child,
Go to Your cross of wood.
#4
Hope of the world, Mary's child,
You're coming soon to reign:
King of the earth, Mary's child,
Walk in our streets again.
