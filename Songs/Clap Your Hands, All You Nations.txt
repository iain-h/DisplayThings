#C
Sing praise to God,
Sing praises to the King,
Sing praises to the King.
(Repeat)
#1
Clap Your hands, all You nations,
Shout to God with cries of joy,
O how awesome is the Lord most high,
The King over all the earth!
#2
He subdued nations under us,
The peoples under our feet,
And He chose our inheritance for us,
The pride of Jacob, whom He loved.
#3
Now our God has ascended
In the midst of shouts of joy,
And the Lord is in among the trumpet sound,
Among the trumpet sound.
#4
For our God is King of all the earth,
Sing Him a psalm of praise,
For He rules above the nations on His throne,
On His holy throne.
#5
All the people are gathered
Of the God of Abraham.
For the kings of all the earth belong to God,
And He is lifted high!
