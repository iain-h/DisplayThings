This is our God, the Servant King,
He calls us now to follow him,
To bring our lives as a daily offering
Of worship to the Servant King.
#1
From heav'n you came, helpless babe,
Entered our world, your glory veiled;
Not to be served but to serve,
And give your life that we might live.
#2
There in the garden of tears,
My heavy load he chose to bear;
His heart with sorrow was torn.
'Yet not my will but yours,' he said.
#3
Come, see His hands and His feet,
The scars that speak of sacrifice,
Hands that flung stars into space,
To cruel nails surrendered.
#4
So let us learn how to serve,
And in our lives enthrone him;
Each other's needs to prefer,
For it is Christ we're serving.
