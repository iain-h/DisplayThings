#C
All Your love (x4)
Pouring out for me like a flood.
#1
Jesus Christ,
You came into this world to rescue me.
On the cross,
My sin was laid on You, what agony.
There Your precious life-blood flowed so free.
Every drop that fell still cleanses me.
#2
I am safe
Upon the ocean of Your mercy.
I am loved
With all the passion of eternity.
It is deeper than the deepest sea;
Like a tidal wave it carries me.
#3
So I stand
Upon Your promise of eternal grace.
I believe
That I will one day see You face to face.
I will worship You forevermore
In ways I never have before.
#B
All Your love (x4)
Sweeping over me like a flood.
