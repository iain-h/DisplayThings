I have a destiny I know I shall fulfil,
I have a destiny in that city on a hill.
I have a destiny and it's not an empty wish,
For I know I was born for such a time as this.
#1
Long before the ages You predestined me
To walk in all the works You have prepared for me.
You've given me a part to play in history
To help prepare a bride for eternity.
#2
I did not choose You but You have chosenme
And appointed me for bearing fruit abundantly.
I know You will complete the work begun in me,
By the power of Your Spirit working mightily.
