#1
No eye has seen, no ear has heard,
No mind has conceived what the Lord has prepared;
But by His Spirit, He has revealed
His plan to those who love Him.
(Repeat)
#2
We've been held by His everlasting love,
Led with loving kindness by His hand;
We have hope for the future yet to come,
In time we'll understand the mystery of His plan.
