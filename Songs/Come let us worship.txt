Come let us worship, come let us bow down
Come let us sing of all, the Lord has done
#1
He made the heavens and they shine His glory
He moves the sun across the sky
So incomparable, the Star of Morning
Radiant in light
#2
He made the world in all its countless wonder
Composed the song creation cries
Our God incredible, immortal Saviour
Jesus   Christ
