I'm going to be a history maker in this land.
I'm going to be a speaker of truth to all mankind.
I'm going to stand,
I'm going to run into your arms,
Into your arms again,
Into your arms, into your arms again.
#1
Is it true today
That when people pray
Cloudless skies will break,
Kings and queens will shake?
Yes, it's true and I believe it,
I'm living for you.
#2
Well, it's true today
That when people pray
We'll see dead men rise
And the blind set free.
Yes, it's true and I believe it,
I'm living for you.
#3
Well, it's true today
That when people stand
With the fire of God
And the truth in hand,
We'll see miracles,
We'll see angels sing,
We'll see broken hearts
Making history.
Yes it's true and I believe it,
I'm living for you.
