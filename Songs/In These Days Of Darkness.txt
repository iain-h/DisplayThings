Oh I, I will carry the fire.
Oh I, I will carry the fire.
#1
In these days of darkness,
Who will bear the light?
In all of this confusion,
Who will rage against the night?
And who will light a beacon
In the face of this dark, dark sky?
#2
Where there is oppression,
Who will raise the flame?
For the sake of all the children,
Who will touch the fields of shame?
And who will light a beacon
In the face of this dark, dark sky,
With a hope that is eternal,
With a love that will never die?
#3
Who will burn with passion,
Blazing from the heart,
To forge a new tomorrow?
We must tell the world
Of a hope that is eternal,
Of a love that will never die.
And we will light a beacon
In the face of this dark, dark sky.
#4
Oh I, I will carry the fire.
Oh I, I will carry the fire.
I will not rest, I will not tire,
With all my strength I'll carry the fire.
I will not rest, I will not tire,
With all my strength I'll carry the fire.
