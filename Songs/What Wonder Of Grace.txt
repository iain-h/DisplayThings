My desire is to come to this place,
My desire is to look on Your face,
Perfect in beauty, in truth and love,
Your glory shines over all the earth;
The King who lavishes grace on us is here.
#1
What Wonder Of Grace is this,
What story of passion divine,
Where judgement and mercy kiss,
Where power and love are entwined?
No tongue can speak this glory,
No words express the joy You bring
As I enter the courts of the King.
#2
Your will is my daily bread,
Enough for my plenty and need;
I'll live by the words You've said,
And follow wherever You lead.
And though my flesh may fail me,
You prove Your grace in all I do,
Lord, my heart is devoted to You.
