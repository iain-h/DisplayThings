Let us with a gladsome mind
Praise the Lord, for He is kind:
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.
Let us blaze His name abroad,
For of gods He is the God:
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

He, with all-commanding might,
Filled the new-made world with light:
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.
He the golden-tressèd sun
Caused all day his course to run:
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.
#3
And the silver moon by night,
'Mid her spangled sisters bright:
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.
He His chosen race did bless
In the wasteful wilderness:
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.
#4
All things living He doth feed,
His full hand supplies their need:
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.
Let us with a gladsome mind
Praise the Lord, for He is kind:
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.
