#1
Where Can I Go without You, Lord?
What can I do, how can I stand?
You are my comfort and my strength.
You are my shield and my right hand.
#2
And You pour out healing on me,
Pour out healing.
And You make my spirit soar,
And You make my burden light,
And You soothe me in the storm,
And You go before me in the fight.
