O praise him, O praise him,
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!
#1
All creatures of our God and king,
Lift up your voice and with us sing:
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
Thou burning sun with golden beam,
Thou silver moon with softer gleam:
#2
Thou rushing wind that art so strong,
Ye clouds that sail in heaven along,
O praise Him, hallelujah!
Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice,
Ye lights of evening, find a voice:
#3
Thou flowing water, pure and clear,
Make music for thy Lord to hear,
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
Thou fire so masterful and bright,
That givest man both warmth and light:
#4
And all ye men of tender heart,
Forgiving others, take your part,
O sing ye, hallelujah!
Ye who long pain and sorrow bear,
Praise God and on Him cast your care:
#5
Let all things their Creator bless,
And worship Him in humbleness,
O praise Him, hallelujah!
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son,
And praise the Spirit, Three-in-One:
