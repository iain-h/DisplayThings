The power and the glory of your name.
The power and the glory of your name.
The power and the glory of your name,
The name of the Lord, the Son of God.

This grace is mine,
This glory, earth-bound heaven sent
This plan divine,
This life, this light that breaks my night,
The Spirit of God
Heaven falls like a dove to my heart.
This love is mine,
So undeserved, this glorious name,
This Son, this God,
This life, this death, this victory won,
Forgiveness has flowed and
This grace that is mine finds my heart.

This love is mine,
So undeserved, this glorious name,
This Son, this God,
This life, this death, this victory won,
Forgiveness has flowed and
This grace that is mine finds my heart.
#3
This life is mine,
So perfect and so pure, this God in me,
This glorious hope
From earth to heaven, death to life,
This future assured and secured
By this love in my heart.
