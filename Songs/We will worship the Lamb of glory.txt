And with our hands lifted high
We will worship and sing,
And with our hands lifted high
We come before you rejoicing.
With our hands lifted high to the sky,
When the world wonders why,
We'll just tell them
We're loving our King.
Oh, we'll just tell them
We're loving our King.
Yes, we'll just tell them
We're loving our King.
#1
We will worship the Lamb of glory,
We will worship the King of kings;
We will worship the Lamb of glory,
We will worship the King.
#2
Bless the name of the Lamb of glory,
I bless the name of the King of kings;
Bless the name of the Lamb of glory,
Bless the name of the King.
