You have broken the chains
That held our captive souls.
You have broken the chains
And used them on your foes.
All your enemies are bound
They tremble at the sound of your name
Jesus you have broken the chains.

O God, most high, almighty king,
The Champion of Heaven, Lord of ev'rything
You've fought, you've won, Death's lost its sting
And standing in your victory we sing
#2
The pow'r of Hell has been undone
Captivity held captive by the Risen One
And in the name of God's own Son,
We claim the mighty victory you've won.
#3
They tremble at the sound of your name
Jesus you have broken the chains.
