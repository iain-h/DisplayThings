So I'll set my sights upon You,
Set my life upon Your praise;
Never looking to another way.
#1
Jesus, You alone shall be
My first love, my first love.
The secret place in highest praise
Shall be Yours, shall be Yours.
#2
To Your throne I'll bring devotion,
May it be the sweetest sound:
Lord, this heart is reaching for You now.
#3
Day and night I lift my eyes
To seek You, to seek You,
Hungry for a glimpse of You
In glory, in glory.
#4
You alone will be my passion,
Jesus, You will be my song:
You will find me longing after You.
