#1
We will cross every border,
Throw wide every door,
Joining our hands across the nations,
We'll proclaim Jesus is Lord.
#2
We will break sin's oppression,
Speak out for the poor,
Announce the coming of Christ's kingdom
From east to west and shore to shore.
#3
We will gather in the harvest,
And work while it's day,
Though we may sow with tears of sadness,
We will reap with shouts of joy.
#4
Soon our eyes shall see His glory,
The Lamb, our risen Lord,
When he receives from every nation
His blood-bought Bride, His great reward.
Then we'll proclaim Jesus is Lord.
We shall proclaim Jesus is Lord.
