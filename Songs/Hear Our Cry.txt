Women: Hear our cry, O hear our cry:
Men: 'Jesus, come!'
Women: Hear our cry, O hear our cry:
Men: 'Jesus, come!'
Women: Whoever is thirsty, come now
And drink the waters of life;
Men: whoever is thirsty, come now
And drink the waters of life.
Women: Hear our cry, O hear our cry:
Men: 'Jesus, come!'
Women: Hear our cry, O hear our cry:
Men: 'Jesus, come!'

The tide of prayer is rising,
A deeper passion burning -
#3
We lift our eyes with longing
To see your kingdom coming -
#4
The streets of teeming cities
Cry out for healing rivers -
#5
Refresh them with your presence,
Give grace for deep repentance -
#6
Tear back the shroud of shadows
That covers all the peoples -
