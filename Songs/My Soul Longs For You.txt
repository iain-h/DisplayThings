#1
My soul longs for You, O my God;
I seek You with all of my heart.
In this dry and thirsty land
My voice cries out to You;
Only Your presence can satisfy my need.
#2
And so I enter into Your sanctuary,
To behold Your glory.
I'll give You my praise as long as I live,
Raise my hands, my life I'll give
To You, O I love You, Lord.
