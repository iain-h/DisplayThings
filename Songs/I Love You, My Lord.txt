#1
I love You, my Lord,
For giving to me Your great salvation,
Setting me free from sin and death
And the kingdom of Satan's destruction.
There's power in the blood
To cleanse all my sin, I know I'm forgiven;
I'm reigning in life, I'm living by faith,
I'm now united with Christ.

(1st part)
I confess with my mouth that Jesus is Lord,
Jesus is Lord, and believe in my heart
He's been raised from the dead.
I confess with my mouth that Jesus is Lord,
Jesus is Lord, and now I have life,
Now I have life by the Spirit of God.
#3
(2nd part)
I confess with my mouth that Jesus is Lord,
And believe in my heart
He's been raised from the dead.
I confess with my mouth that Jesus is my Lord,
And now I have life by the Spirit of God.
