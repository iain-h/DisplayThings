And he will be called wonderful,
Wonderful Counsellor, mighty God,
The everlasting Father,
Prince of Peace, mighty God.

For unto us a child is born,
Unto us a son is giv'n,
And the government shall be upon His shoulders.
For unto us a child is born,
Unto us a son is giv'n,
And the government shall be upon His shoulders.

And there shall be no end
To the increase of His rule,
To the increase of His government and peace.
For he shall sit on David's throne
Upholding righteousness.
Our God shall accomplish this.
#3
For he is the mighty God,
He is the Prince of Peace,
The King of kings and Lord of lords.
All honour to the King,
All glory to His name,
For now and evermore.
