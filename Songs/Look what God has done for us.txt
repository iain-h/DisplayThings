#1
Look what God has done for us,
Over all the years we've shared,
Ever since the day
He joined our flickering lights into one flame.
Look at all the lives he's changed,
By His grace we're not the same;
All the fruit that's grown,
All that's yet to come,
Look what God has done.
And His love goes on and on for ever.
#2
Look at all we've shared in him,
Joy and laughter, tears and pain,
Grace to carry on when darks were dark
And all our strength was gone.
Look at all the prayers he's heard,
All the times he's proved His word;
Blessing on our homes,
Children that have grown,
Look what God has done.
And His love goes on and on for ever.
#3
Freely we have all received,
Freely we must also give,
Thinking of the price he paid
That we might be His very own.
Born for such a time as this,
Chosen for the harvest years,
We have just begun,
The best is yet to come,
Look what God has done.
And His love goes on and on for ever.
