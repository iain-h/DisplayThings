Make way (make way),
Make way (make way),
For the King of kings
(for the King of kings);
Make way (make way),
Make way (make way),
And let His kingdom in!
#1
Make way, make way, for Christ the King
In splendour arrives;
Fling wide the gates and welcome him
Into your lives.
#2
He comes the broken hearts to heal,
The prisoners to free;
The deaf shall hear, the lame shall dance,
The blind shall see.
#3
And those who mourn with heavy hearts,
Who weep and sigh,
With laughter, joy and royal crown
He'll beautify.
#4
We call you now to worship him
As Lord of all,
To have no gods before him,
Their thrones must fall.
