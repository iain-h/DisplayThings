Alleluia! alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia!
#1
From all that dwell below the skies
Let the Creator's praise arise:
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Let the Redeemer's name be sung
Through every land, by every tongue.
#2
Eternal are Thy mercies, Lord;
Eternal truth attends Thy word:
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Thy praise shall sound from shore toshore,
Till suns shall rise and set no more.
#3
Your lofty themes, ye mortals, bring,
In songs of praise divinely sing:
Alleluia! Alleluia!
The great salvation loud proclaim,
And shout for joy the Saviour's name.
#4
In every land begin the song;
To every land the strains belong.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
In cheerful sounds all voices raise,
And fill the world with loudest praise.
