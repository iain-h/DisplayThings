By Your Spirit and Your word,
We would hasten Your return.
(Repeat)
#1
Give me, Lord, a dream from heaven,
Let me see the things You see;
Give me purpose and direction,
Holy Spirit, move on me.
I would set my face to serve You,
To do the things You'd have me do;
Stir within my heart a vision,
Lord, I will follow You.
#2
Give to me a holy passion,
With every breath I will proclaim
The message of Your kingdom,
The glory of Your name.
Lead me into action,
Let me do the things You say;
Send me to the nations,
When You speak I will obey.
#3
I believe that faith is rising,
I can see a tidal wave
Of Your Spirit that is moving
To end this final age.
There'll be shouts of acclamation
When You come back for Your Bride;
History's consummation
Is here before our eyes.
