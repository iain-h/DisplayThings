#C
I can only give my heart to You,
I can only give my heart.
(Repeat)
#1
I Am Helplessly In Love With You.
I am lost in something precious.
I am drowning in the sea of You.
I am found amongst Your treasures.
#2
And I don't know why You give Yourself,
And I can't explain why You should care.
When all heaven sings Your glory,
I'm humbled that You hear my prayer.
#3
I am helplessly devoted to You;
I am scorched by strange new fire.
I am running deeper into You.
I am high upon the wire.
#4
It's like breathing some strange new air,
Walking on some distant moon.
I'll sing a song from the depths of my soul:
Seeking, finding, coming home.
Seeking, finding, coming home.
