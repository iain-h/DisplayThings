#C
And I will seek Your lovely face,
Through the veil I'll come,
To love You in Your dwelling place,
To gaze upon Your throne.
(Repeat)
#1
I've Come To Meet With You, my God,
To bless Your heart, my King;
To be with You, to know Your love,
To give an offering.
#2
Your grace and love have come to me,
You've set this captive free.
This child is Yours, You have redeemed
For life eternally.
#3
I know the punishment You took for me;
Thank You, Saviour, for the cost,
That set me free,
That set me free.
