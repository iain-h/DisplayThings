O give thanks to the Lord
For His love endures,
O give thanks to the Lord
For His love endures,
O give thanks to the Lord
For His love endures
For ever, for ever.
#1
The Lord is marching out in splendour,
In awesome majesty he rides,
For truth, humility and justice,
His mighty army fills the skies.
#2
His army marches out with dancing
For he has filled our hearts with joy.
Be glad the kingdom is advancing,
The love of God, our battle cry!
