Hear the sound that fills heaven,
Hear the beat of my heart.
(Repeat)
#1
Catch the fire,
Swim through the waters,
Fly on the wings of the Spirit.
(Repeat)
#2
As a Lover, gazing on His bride;
As a Father looking for His child;
As the Shepherd,
Searching for the one that's lost;
As the Saviour, weeping for the world.
