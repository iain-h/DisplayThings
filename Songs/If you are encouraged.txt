By being of the same mind,
And loving with the same love,
United in the Spirit,
With the same goal in sight.
By being of the same mind,
And loving with the same love,
United in the Spirit
To the glory of Christ.
#1
If you are encouraged
In our union with Christ,
Finding consolation in His love,
Compassion, warmth and friendship
In the Spirit's flow of life;
This is how you make my joy complete:
#2
Be sure you do nothing
Out of selfishness or pride,
Never seeing past your own concerns;
But humbly keep the interests
Of each other in your hearts,
Seeing them as better than yourselves:
