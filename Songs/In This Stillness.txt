Risen Healer, conquering Saviour,
King of kings and Prince of Peace.
Faithful Father, my Friend forever,
I will live to bring You praise.
#1
In This Stillness I will worship,
Love You, Jesus,
I turn toward to kiss Your face.
I come running, thirsting, longing
For You, Jesus,
In the quiet of this place.
Draw me closer to You, Jesus,
I would be with You.
#2
In Your presence I will bow down,
Join with the angels
Singing 'Holy is Your name'.
In this moment heaven's fragrance
Touches earth and
I can feel Your kingdom come.
Draw me closer to You, Jesus,
I would be with You.
