#1
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
'Come unto me and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one,
Lay down thy head upon my breast.'
I came to Jesus as I was,
So weary, worn and sad;
I found in him a resting-place,
And he has made me glad.
#2
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
'Behold, I freely give
The living water, thirsty one;
Stoop down and drink and live.'
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
And now I live in him.
#3
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
'I am this dark world's light;
Look unto me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright.'
I looked to Jesus, and I found
In him my star, my sun;
And in that light of life I'll walk
Till travelling days are done.
