#1
We See The Lord,
And He is high upon the throne,
And His glory fills the heavens and the earth.
One like a Lamb
Who was slain is on the throne,
And so I cast my crown before You
And bow down to praise.
For everything cries holy.
Oh, everything cries holy.
Oh, everything cries holy to You, Lord.
(Repeat)
