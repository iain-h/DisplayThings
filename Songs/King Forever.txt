And we will sing hosanna to Jesus,
We exalt and raise Your name above;
And we proclaim the glory of Jesus,
Prince of Peace, and worthy King of love.
#1
King forever, Lord messiah,
He who was, and is, and is to come;
Prince of glory, name of Jesus,
Be Your praise and worship ever sung.
#2
Lord anointed, our salvation,
He whom angels call the Word of God;
True and faithful, Lamb of mercy,
Now receive our worship and our love.
