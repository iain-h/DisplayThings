#1
Come down, O Love divine,
Seek thou this soul of mine,
And visit it with
Thine own ardour glowing;
O Comforter, draw near,
Within my heart appear,
And kindle it,
Thy holy flame bestowing.
#2
O let it freely burn,
Till earthly passions turn
To dust and ashes
In its heat consuming;
And let thy glorious light
Shine ever on my sight,
And clothe me round,
The while my path illuming.
#3
Let holy charity
Mine outward vesture be,
And lowliness become
Mine inner clothing;
True lowliness of heart,
Which takes the humbler part,
And o'er its own shortcomings
Weeps with loathing.
#4
And so the yearning strong,
With which the soul will long,
Shall far outpass
The pow'r of human telling;
Nor can we guess its grace,
Till we become the place
Wherein the Holy Spirit
Makes His dwelling.
