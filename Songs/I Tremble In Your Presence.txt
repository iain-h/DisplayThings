Oh, how I long for You.
Oh, how I long for You.
Oh, how I long for You, oh.
#1
I Tremble In Your Presence,
I am humbled that You came,
Yet I know it's all because I choose to praise You.
I recognise Your fragrance,
As Your glory fills this place;
All I'd planned to say means nothing now.
#2
I shiver in Your presence,
I am frozen by my shame.
My heart is breaking more than I can stand it.
Your radiance is blinding,
Yet You hug me like a friend,
I am overcome by Your mercy again.
