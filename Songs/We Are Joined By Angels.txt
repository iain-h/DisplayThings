And we cry together: Holy, holy
For there is no other like You, Lord.
We declare together: You are awesome,
You are to be feared, honoured and revered,
For You are the Lord.

We Are Joined By Angels,
Our purpose the same:
To worship the one and only God,
A little piece of heaven is in this place.
#2
We are joined by angels,
With one voice we sing,
As we lift our hands to honour You,
In worship, the angels extend their wings.
