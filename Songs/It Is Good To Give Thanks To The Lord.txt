O give thanks to the Lord,
For His love endures forever.
O give thanks to the Lord,
For the Lord alone is good.
#1
It is good to give thanks to the Lord,
To remember all He has done;
Then God will remember our praises
When He looks with love on His people.
#2
Our sin is the sin of our fathers,
We have done wrong, we all have been evil;
Like those who once lived in bondage,
We paid no heed to all You had done.
#3
Our fathers forsook Your love,
At the Red Sea they questioned their God;
They fell from their faith in the desert,
And put God to the test in the wilderness.
#4
Time after time He would rescue them,
Yet in malice they dared to defy Him;
Despite this He came to their aid
When He heard their cries of distress.
#5
Save us, O Lord, in Your love;
Bring us back from all that offends You.
Look not alone at our sins,
But remember your promise of mercy.
#6
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel
Both now and through all eternity;
Let nations and people cry out
And sing Amen! Alleluia!
