#1
Crown him with many crowns
The Lamb upon His throne
Hear how the songs in Heaven drown
All music but their own
Awake, my soul, and sing
Of Him who died for you
And hail Him as your matchless King
For all the ages through
#2
Crown Him the Lord of life
Who triumphed o'er the grave
And rose victorious as he said
For those He came to save
His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high
Who died to bring eternal life
And lives that death may die
#3
Crown Him the Lord of love
Come see His hands and side
The scars are visible above
But now are glorified
No angel in the sky
Can know his hearts delight
For only He can know the plan
He has within his sight
#4
Crown Him the Lord of years
Who reigns through space and time
Creator of the universe
Whose heights we cannot climb
I owe a debt so great
For you have died for me
Your praise shall never, ever fail
Throughout eternity
