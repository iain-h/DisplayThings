O, I could sing unending songs
Of how you saved my soul.
Well, I could dance a thousand miles
Because of your great love.
#1
My heart is bursting, Lord,
To tell of all you've done.
Of how you changed my life
And wiped away the past.
I wanna shout it out,
From every roof-top sing.
For now I know that God
Is for me, not against me.
#2
Everybody's singing now,
'cos we're so happy!
Everybody's dancing now,
'cos we're so happy!
If only we could see your face
And see you smiling over us
And unseen angels celebrate,
For joy is in this place.
