One heart, one voice, one mind.
One in Spirit, and one in love.
This will be the hope that we long for,
This will be the covenant we live,
One heart, one voice, one mind.
#1
Heirs of God, and children of the kingdom.
Living proof that he's alive.
We're reconciled, sinners now forgiven.
One in heart, and one in voice and mind.
