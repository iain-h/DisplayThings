All of You is more than enough for
All of me, for every thirst and every need,
You satisfy me with Your love,
And all I have in You
Is more than enough.
#1
You're my supply,
My breath of life;
Still more awesome than I know.
You're my reward,
Worth living for;
Still more awesome than I know.
#2
You're my sacrifice
Of greatest price;
Still more awesome than I know.
You're my coming King,
You are everything;
Still more awesome than I know.
#3
More than all I want,
More than all I need,
You are more than enough for me.
More than all I know,
More than all I can,
You are more than enough.
