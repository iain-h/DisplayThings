Thank You, O my Father,
For giving us Your Son,
And leaving Your Spirit-
Till the work on earth is done.
#1
There is a redeemer,
Jesus, God's own Son,
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,
Holy One.
#2
Jesus my Redeemer,
Name above all names,
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,
O for sinners slain.
#3
When I stand in glory
I will see His face,
And there I'll serve my King forever
In that holy place.
