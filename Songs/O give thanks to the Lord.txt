O give thanks to the Lord,
For His love will never end.
O give thanks to the Lord,
For His love it never will end.
(Repeat)
#1
Sing to him, sing your praise to him.
Tell the world of all he has done.
Fill the nations with celebrations,
To welcome him as he comes.
#2
Give him thanks for the fruitful earth,
For the sun, the seasons, the rain.
For the joys of His good creation,
The life and breath he sustains.
#3
Let the heavens rejoice before him,
The earth and all it contains.
All creation in jubilation,
Join in the shout, 'The Lord reigns!'
#4
Let the hearts of those who seek him
Be happy now in His love.
Let their faces look up and gaze
At His gracious smile from above.
