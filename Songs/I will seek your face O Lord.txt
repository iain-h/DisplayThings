I will seek your face, O Lord;
I will seek your face, O Lord;
I will seek your face, O Lord;
I will seek your face, O Lord.
#1
Lord, how awesome is your presence.
Who can stand in your light?
Those who by your grace and mercy
Are made holy in your sight.
#2
I will dwell in your presence
All the days of my life;
There to gaze upon your glory,
And to worship only you.
