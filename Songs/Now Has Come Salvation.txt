You are the One that I love, my Lord,
You are the One all of heaven adores.
You are the One who is high
Over all the earth.
Jesus, my risen Saviour,
Jesus, my risen Saviour.

Now has come Your strength,
And the kingdom of my God,
And the power of His Christ,
Jesus, holy One,
Jesus, holy One.

Now has come Your mercy,
Now has come Your peace,
And the glory of Your presence,
And the greatness of Your name,
Jesus, holy One,
Jesus, holy One.

Now has come forgiveness,
Now has come Your grace,
And the precious Holy Spirit,
And the freedom that You gave
In Jesus, holy One,
Jesus, holy One.
