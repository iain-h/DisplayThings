#C
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
Jesus loves us all.
(Repeat)
#1
Whether you're one or whether you're two
Or three or four or five,
Six or seven or eight or nine it's good to be alive.
It really doesn't matter how old you are,
Jesus loves you whoever you are.
#2
Whether you're big or whether you're small
Or somewhere in between,
First in the class or middle or last,
We're all the same to Him.
It really doesn't matter how clever you are,
Jesus loves you whoever you are.
