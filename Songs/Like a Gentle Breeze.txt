#1
Like a gentle breeze, like a mighty wind,
Like a roaring fire,
You will visit us, you will cleanse our souls,
And our hearts inspire,
Bringing peace to us, like a healing balm,
Or a gentle dove;
O come to us, O bring to us
God's gifts of love.
#2
Come with holy fire,
Melt these hearts of clay.
Let them beat with love
That will never fade.
Holy Spirit come,
Holy Spirit come,
Holy Spirit come again.
