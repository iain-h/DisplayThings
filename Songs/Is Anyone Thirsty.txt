O let the living waters flow,
O let the living waters flow,
Let the river of your Spirit flow through me;
O let the living waters flow,
O let the living waters flow,
Let the river of your Spirit flow through me.
(Last time)
Flow through me.
Flow through me.

Jesus said, 'Let them come to me and drink,
Let them come to me.'
