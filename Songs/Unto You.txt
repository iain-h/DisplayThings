Wanting to, give you my devotion
I wanna give it all
Unto you, show you that I love you
I wanna give it all
#1
There's nothing better than this
I know I would miss
All the things you would show me
Since you knocked on my door
I now know I'm wanting more
All this love you will show me
#2
All the things that you do
O how they remind me of you
So I give my heart to show you
There's nothing stronger than this
Such a relation like this
How you make me wonder
#3
All the things that I need
And how you make me feel
Just wanting more
I don't know where I would be
If you hadn't rescued me
I just wanna thank you
