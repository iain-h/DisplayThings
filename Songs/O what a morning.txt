Christ is risen!
He's alive, alleluia!
Yes, he's risen,
He's alive, alleluia!
#1
O, what a morning, O, how glorious,
O, what a light has broken through!
Out of the tomb of death and dark despair,
Angels in white announce incredible news.
#2
Suddenly hope has filled our darkest night,
Suddenly life has blossomed here;
Suddenly joy has rushed like rivers,
He is alive and love has conquered our fear.
