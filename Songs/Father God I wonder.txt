Father God, I wonder
How I managed to exist
Without the knowledge of your parenthood
And your loving care.
But now I am your child,
I am adopted in your family
And I can never be alone
'cause, Father God, you're there beside me.
#2
I will sing your praises,
I will sing your praises,
I will sing your praises,
For evermore.
I will sing your praises,
I will sing your praises,
I will sing your praises,
For evermore.
