I believe that the presence of God is here;
There's not one thing that can't be changed
When the Spirit of God is near.
I believe that the presence of God is here;
When two or three are gathered,
When people rise in faith,
I believe God answers
And His presence is in this place.
#1
I believe the promise
About the visions and the dreams
That the Holy Spirit will be poured out
And His power will be seen.
Well, the time is now
And the place is here
And His people have come in faith;
There's a mighty sound and a touch of fire
When we're gathered in once place.
#2
Nothing in earth or heaven
Can stop the power of God;
Into our hands is given
The call to take it on;
No ocean can contain it,
No star can rise above;
Into our hearts is given
The power of His love.
