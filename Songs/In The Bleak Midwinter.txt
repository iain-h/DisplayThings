In the bleak midwinter
Frosty wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron,
Water like a stone
Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
Snow on Snow
In the bleak midwinter,
Long ago.
#2
Our God, heaven cannot hold him
Nor earth sustain
Heaven and Earth shall flee away
When he comes to reign.
In the bleak midwinter
A stable place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty
Jesus Christ.
#3
Angels and Archangels
May have gathered there
Cherubim and Seraphim
Thronged the air
But his mother only,
In her maiden bliss
Worshipped the beloved
With a kiss.
#4
What can I give him
Poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd,
I would bring a lamb
If I were a wise man
I would do my part,
Yet what I can I give Him
Give him my heart.
