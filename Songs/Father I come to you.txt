Unending love,
Your unending love.
#1
Father, I come to you,
Lifting up my hands
In the name of Jesus,
By your grace I stand.
Just because you love me
And I love your Son,
I know your favour,
Unending love.
#2
I receive your favour,
Your unending love,
Not because I've earned it,
Not for what I've done,
Just because you love me
And I love your Son,
I know your favour,
Unending love.
#3
It's the presence of your kingdom
As your glory fills this place,
And I see how much you love me
As I look into your face.
Nothing could be better,
There's nothing I would trade
For your favour,
Unending love.
