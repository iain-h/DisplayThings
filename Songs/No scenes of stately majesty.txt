#1
No scenes of stately majesty
For the King of kings.
No nights aglow with candle flame
For the King of love.
No flags of empire hung in shame
For Calvary.
No flowers perfumed the lonely way
That led him to
A borrowed tomb for Easter Day.
#2
No wreaths upon the ground were laid
For the King of kings.
Only a crown of thorns remained
Where he gave His love.
A message scrawled in irony û
King of the Jews û
Lay trampled where they turned away,
And no one knew
That it was the first Easter Day.
#3
Yet nature's finest colours blaze
For the King of kings.
And stars in jewelled clusters say,
'Worship heaven's King.'
Two thousand springtimes more have bloomed û
Is that enough?
Oh, how can I be satisfied
Until he hears
The whole world sing of Easter love.
#4
My prayers shall be a fragrance sweet
For the King of kings.
My love the flowers at His feet
For the King of love.
My vigil is to watch and pray
Until he comes.
My highest tribute to obey
And live to know
The pow'r of that first Easter Day.
#5
I long for scenes of majesty
For the risen King.
For nights aglow with candle flame
For the King of love.
A nation hushed upon its knees
At Calvary,
Where all our sins and griefs were nailed
And hope was born
Of everlasting Easter Day.
