For You gave me a heart
And You gave me a smile,
You gave me Jesus
And You made me Your child,
And I just thank You, Father,
For making me 'me'.
#1
If I were a butterfly,
I'd thank You, Lord, for giving me wings.
And if I were a robin in a tree,
I'd thank You, Lord, that I could sing.
And if I were a fish in the sea,
I'd wiggle my tail and I'd giggle with glee;
But I just thank You, Father,
For making me 'me'.
#2
If I were an elephant,
I'd thank You, Lord, by raising my trunk.
And if I were a kangaroo,
You know I'd hop right up to You.
And if I were an octopus,
I'd thank You, Lord, for my fine looks;
But I just thank You, Father,
For making me 'me'.
#3
If I were a wiggily worm,
I'd thank You, Lord, that I could squirm.
And if I were a billy goat,
I'd thank You, Lord, for my strong throat.
And if I were a fuzzy-wuzzy bear,
I'd thank You, Lord, for my fuzzy-wuzzy hair;
But I just thank You, Father,
For making me 'me'.
