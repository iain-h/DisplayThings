Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending, your glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart is to bring You praise
From the inside out, Lord my soul cries out
#1
A thousand times I've failed, still your mercy remains
And should I stumble again, still I'm caught in your grace
Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending, your glory goes beyond all fame
#2
In my heart and my soul, Lord I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord
Let justice and praise, become my embrace
To love you from the inside out
#3
Your will above all else, my purpose remains
The art of losing myself, in bringing you praise
Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending, your glory goes beyond all fame
