How high and how wide
How deep and how long
How sweet and how strong is your love
How lavish Your grace
How faithful Your ways
How great is Your love O Lord
#1
No eye has seen and no ear has heard
And no mind has ever conceived
The glorious things that You have prepared
For everyone who has believed
You brought us near and You called us Your own
And made us joint heirs with Your Son
#2
Objects of mercy who should have known wrath
We're filled with unspeakable joy
Riches of wisdom unsearchable wealth
And the wonder of knowing Your voice
You are our treasure and our great reward
Our hope and our glorious King
