And we know he is coming back again
In pow'r and glory.
He is coming back again
To claim His people;
He is coming back again
To bring His children home with him,
Home with him.
#1
He is the mighty God,
He is the risen King,
He is the Lord of lords.
He is the first and last,
He is holy, he is true,
He is the Lord of lords.
#2
He is the One who gave
His life for all the world,
He is the Lord of lords,
Who rose up from the grave,
Defeated death and hell;
He is the Lord of lords.
#3
He's coming in the clouds
And every eye shall see
He is the Lord of lords;
Then every knee shall bow
And every tongue proclaim
He is the Lord of lords.
