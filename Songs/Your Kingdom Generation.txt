Your Kingdom Generation
Declares Your majesty,
And our lives are resounding with Your praise.
We see Your Spirit moving,
We burn with holy fire.
Your glory is seen through all the earth.
You set eternity in my heart,
So I'll live for You, for You.
#2
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Honour and praise forever.
We'll shout a victory cry from here
To eternity.
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
We'll take our place in history.
We'll shout Your awesome love from here
To eternity.
