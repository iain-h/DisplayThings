We've got something to celebrate
To shout about: our God is great 
He's worthy to be praised and have the highest anthem raised to his name
#2
Songs of praise and liberty
We'll sing and shout to him for he has 
Risen from the grave
And we can sing 'cos we are saved and set free
#3
No more lost, no more in darkness
We were like sheep, but our God has found us
Gave us sight, freedom and much more
He gave us something worth living for
#4
Tied in chains, in sin we were bound we were
Caught in a trap but when Jesus found us
He lifted us up with his own hand
Now on Christ the solid rock we stand
