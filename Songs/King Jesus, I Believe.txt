I'm thirsty, longing just to see Your kingdom come,
Praying that today Your love is shown.
I'm hungry for the will of God to be made known,
Praying for the day of Your return.
#1
King Jesus, I Believe
The words of life You breathe,
Your spoken promises,
A guiding light for our feet.
We fall down to our knees
And weep with those who weep:
Let justice flow upon this earth,
A never failing stream.
#2
You have anointed us
To bind the broken heart:
Proclaim deliverance
For those enslaved in the dark.
You pour the oil of joy
All over my despair.
O Spirit of the Sovereign Lord,
Empower us once again.
#3
We pray, we pray,
We pray for the kingdom.
We pray, we pray.
