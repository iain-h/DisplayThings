#C
Lift him up, lift him high,
Let His praises fill the sky.
Oh, heaven's gates are open wide
To those who hear the call.
(Repeat)
#1
Through every generation
This truth will always shine,
That Christ came down among us,
Now He is glorified.
#2
The message of the kingdom
Stands unshakeable through time:
That man can be forgiven,
If you seek then you will find.
