You're the Father to the fatherless,
The answer to my dreams.
I see you crowned in righteousness.
We cry glory to the King.
Comforter to the lonely,
The lifter of my head,
I see you veiled in majesty,
We cry glory, glory,
We cry glory, to the King.
We cry glory, glory,
We cry glory, to the King.
#1
Lord, my heart cries out,
Glory to the King,
My greatest love in life.
I hand you everything.
Glory, glory, I hear the angels sing.
#2
Open my ears,
Let me hear your voice
To know that sweet sound.
O, my soul, rejoice.
Glory, glory, I hear the angels sing.
