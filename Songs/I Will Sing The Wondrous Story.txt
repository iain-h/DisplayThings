Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me
Sing it with the saints in glory
Gathered by the crystal sea
#1
I will sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me
How He left His home in glory
For the cross on Calvary
#2
I was lost but Jesus found me
Found the sheep that went astray
Threw His loving arms around me
Drew me back into His way
#3
He will keep me till the river
Rolls its waters at my feet
Then He'll bear me safely over
Saved by grace and made complete
