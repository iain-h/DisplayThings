#1
Draw me close to the cross,
To the place of Your love,
To the place where You poured out Your mercy;
Where the river of life
That flows from Your wounded side
Brings refreshing to those who draw near.
#2
Draw me close to Your throne
Where Your majesty is shown,
Where the crown of my life I lay down.
Draw me close to Your side,
Where my heart is satisfied,
Draw me close to You, Lord,
Draw me close.
