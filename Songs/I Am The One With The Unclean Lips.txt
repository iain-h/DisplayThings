Wash me clean in Your river of mercy.
Restore my soul by a clear blue stream.
Wash me clean in Your river of mercy,
Restore my soul, renew me again.
#1
I Am The One With The Unclean Lips,
I am the one whose mind is jaded.
I am the one with the impure heart,
And all my innocence has faded.
#2
I am the one whose walk is faithless,
I am the one who walks away.
I am the one whose debts are many
And I am the one who cannot pay.
#3
You are the Lord who is my fortress;
You are the Lord who is my hope.
You are the Lord who is my refuge,
The only safe place for my soul.
