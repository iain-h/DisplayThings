You are my shield My strength 
My portion, deliverer 
My shelter strong tower
My very present help in time of need
#1
I will bless the Lord forever
I will trust Him at all times
He has delivered me from all fear
He has set my feet upon a rock
I will not be moved and I'll say of the Lord
#2
Whom have I in Heaven but you? 
There's none I desire beside you
#3
And I will not be moved and I'll say of the Lord
