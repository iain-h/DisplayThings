And Lord we want to lift Your name on high.
And Lord we want to thank You
For the works You've done in our lives.
And Lord we trust in Your unfailing love.
For You alone are God eternal
Throughout earth and heaven above.

Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise
The city of our God, the holy place
The joy of the whole earth.
Great is the Lord in whom we have the victory.
He aids us against the enemy
We bow down on our knees
