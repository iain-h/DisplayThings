#1
Lord, To Love You More is all I want,
To hear You speaking to my heart,
To be consumed by You again.
Fix my eyes on You and draw me near,
Let all distractions disappear,
I need You even more today.
#2
For Jesus, I am overwhelmed
By all Your love has done,
And all I want to say is that I adore You, Lord.
I'm humbled by the grace of God,
You met my every need,
And Jesus, You will be always my greatest love.
#3
I adore You. (x4)
