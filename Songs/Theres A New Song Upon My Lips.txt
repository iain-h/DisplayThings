You're the God of great things,
You're the God of great things.
I won't hold back my thanks to You.
Thank You, thank You,
Hey, Jesus, I adore You.
Thank You, thank You,
Hey, Jesus, I live for You.

There's A New Song Upon My Lips,
A song I always knew.
Thank You for all that You do.
There is fire burning in my heart,
A fire of faith in You.
I believe all the things we can do.
#2
There's a beat pounding through my feet,
A new dance of thanks to You.
I'm tasting the joy found in You.
There is courage building in my heart;
A strength that comes from You.
I'm going to live my life for You.
