We like sheep have gone astray,
Turned each one to His own way,
And the Lord has laid on him
The iniquity of us all.
#1
He was pierced for our transgressions,
And bruised for our iniquities;
And to bring us peace he was punished,
And by His stripes we are healed.
#2
He was led like a lamb to the slaughter,
Although he was innocent of crime;
And cut off from the land of the living,
He paid for the guilt that was mine.
