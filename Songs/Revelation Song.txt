Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty
Who was, and is, and is to come
With all creation I sing praise to the King of Kings
You are my everything and I will adore You
#1
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Holy, Holy, is He
Sing a new song, to him who sits on
Heaven's mercy seat
#2
Clothed in rainbows, of living colour
Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder
Blessing and honour, strength and glory and power be
To You the only wise King
#3
Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder
At the mention of your name
Jesus your name is power, breath and living water
Such a marvellous mystery
