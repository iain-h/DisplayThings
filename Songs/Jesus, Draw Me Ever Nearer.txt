May this journey bring a blessing,
May I rise on wings of faith:
And at the end of my heart's testing,
With Your likeness let me wake.
#1
Jesus, Draw Me Ever Nearer,
As I labour through the storm.
You have called me to this passage,
And I'll follow, though I'm worn.
#2
Jesus, guide me through the tempest,
Keep my spirit staid and sure.
When the midnight meets the morning,
Let me love You even more.
#3
Let the treasures of the trial
Form within me as I go.
And at the end of this long passage,
Let me leave them at Your throne.
