I worship you, eternal God,
I worship you, the unchanging One.
Before the angels ever sang one song,
Before the morning stars had ever shone,
You were on the throne, eternal God.
#1
Though the earth should tremble
And the oceans roar
And the mountains slip into the sea,
I shall not fear any harm
With your powerful arms around me.
#2
Though earth's kingdoms crumble
And the nations rage
And rulers and kings come and go,
Yours is the kingdom unshaken,
And you've never forsaken your own.
