I love You, You know it's true.
And all I want is to be close to You.
#1
I'm Grateful for the way You look at me.
I'm thankful that You don't give up.
You're a friend who's smiled at me a thousand times.
When I cause You pain, You bring me love.
#2
I've found a place where I'm free.
I'm dancing now, 'cause You love me.
(You love me, You love me, You love me.)
#3
When I've done the worst,
You've seen the best in me.
I was running away,
But You brought some rest to me.
My heart is Yours and I give it all to You.
And when it's tough, I know You'll
Pull me through.
