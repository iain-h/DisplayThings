#C
Take our lives as a sacrifice;
Shine in us Your holy light.
Purify our hearts' desire;
Be to us a consuming fire.
#1
You have called us chosen,
A royal priesthood,
A holy nation,
We belong to You.
YOU HAVE CALLED US CHOSEN,
A royal priesthood,
A holy nation,
We belong to You.
#2
You have shown us mercy,
You have redeemed us;
Our hearts cry ‘Father,
We belong to You.'
(Repeat)
