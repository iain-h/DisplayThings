Jesus, You're All I Need,
You're all I need.
Now I give my life to You alone,
You are all I need.
Jesus, You're all I need,
You're all I need.
Lord, You gave Yourself so I could live,
You are all I need.
#2
Oh, You purchased my salvation,
And wiped away my tears;
Now I drink Your living water,
And I'll never thirst again.
For You alone are holy,
I'll worship at Your throne;
And You will reign forever,
Holy is the Lord.
