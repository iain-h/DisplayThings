#1
I'm Crying Out, let everybody hear
This message loud and clear.
I'm crying out, I want the world to know
That Jesus is my hope.
#2
I've chosen to believe
That God has chosen me
Now at this time.
He turned my life around,
I make a different sound,
Now I want to be a sign.
Harvest fields are white,
Wanna do what's right,
Can't keep it to myself,
Gotta go, gotta tell everyone, yeah.
