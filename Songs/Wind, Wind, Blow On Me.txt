Wind, wind, blow on me,
Wind, wind, set me free,
Wind, wind, my Father sent
The blessed Holy Spirit.
#1
Jesus told us all about You,
How we could not live without You,
With His blood the power bought,
To help us live the life He taught.
#2
When we're weary, You console us;
When we're lonely You enfold us;
When in danger You uphold us,
Blessed Holy Spirit.
#3
When unto the church You came
It was not in Your own but Jesus' name.
Jesus Christ is still the same,
He sends the Holy Spirit.
#4
Set us free to love our brothers;
Set us free to live for others,
That the world the Son might see,
And Jesus' name exalted be.
