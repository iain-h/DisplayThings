O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,

O come, all ye faithful,
Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
Come and behold him,
Born the king of angels:

God of God,
Light of Light,
Lo, he abhors not the Virgin's womb;
Very God,
Begotten not created:
#3
Sing, choirs of angels,
Sing in exultation,
Sing, all ye citizens of heav'n above;
Glory to God
In the highest:
#4
Yea, Lord, we greet thee,
Born this happy morning,
Jesus, to thee be glory giv'n;
Word of the Father,
Now in flesh appearing:
