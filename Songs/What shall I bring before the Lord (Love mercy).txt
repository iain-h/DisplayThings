Show justice, love mercy
Walk humbly with your God
Show justice, love mercy
Walk humbly with your God
#1
What shall I bring before the Lord 
And bow my knee before my God?
Extravagant sacrifice?
Can I give you a thousand words
or please you with ten thousand songs?
Extravagant sacrifice?
#2
My life I bring before the Lord
And bow my knee before my God
Extravagant sacrifice?
My love more than a thousand words
My praise more than ten thousand songs
Extravagant sacrifice

You have shown us what is good
Through the message of your son.
His life his death poured out for us
His words his ways our life blood
