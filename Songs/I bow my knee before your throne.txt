Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, glory to the King.
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, glory to the King.
#1
I bow my knee before your throne,
I know my life is not my own;
I offer up a song of praise
To bring you pleasure, Lord.
#2
I seek the giver, not the gift,
My heart's desire is to lift you
High above all earthly kings;
To bring you pleasure, Lord.
