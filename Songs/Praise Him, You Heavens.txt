Great in power, great in glory,
Great in mercy, King of heaven.
Great in battle, great in wonder,
Great in Zion, King over all the earth.

Praise Him, You Heavens
And all that's above.
Praise Him, you angels
And heavenly hosts.
Let the whole earth praise Him.
Praise Him, the sun, moon
And bright shining stars.
Praise Him, you heavens
And waters and skies.
Let the whole earth praise Him.
