In mystery reigning, King over all,
Hear angels proclaiming, Jesus is Lord.
To each generation Your love is the same;
Wonderful Saviour, we worship Your name.
A beauty that's timeless, who can compare?
All earth stands in silence, when You appear.
Your kingdom is boundless, Your love without end;
Wonder of wonders, this King is my friend!
All power has been given into Your hands;
Through blood and by suffering You now command.
And no opposition can stand in Your light;
Crowned King of heaven, we kneel at the sight.
