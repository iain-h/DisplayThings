Come on, all us singers, sing
That Jesus Christ is Lord.
Come on, all us singers, sing
That Jesus Christ is Lord.
(Repeat)
#1
As your people, Lord,
We now stand before your throne.
A sacrifice of praise will be our song.
As your singers, Lord,
We will shout that 'he is good,
For His love endures for ever'.
#2
As your people, Lord,
We will sing with thankfulness.
We want our lives to be a song of praise.
Banners we will wave
To proclaim that 'he is good,
For His love endures for ever'.
#3
Help us, Lord, to realise
That our lips were made for praising you,
Not for bringing others down,
But for boasting of your love.
Show us, Lord, that when we meet,
We have our feet on holy ground.
Come and purify our lives,
Forgive us for the wrong we've done.
We desire to see your face
But teach us first to fear the Lord.
Let us not presume your grace
For the sin we bring is our disgrace.
In your mercy send your pow'r,
Demons go in Jesus' name.
Heal the sick and save the lost,
Reveal the power of the cross.
#4
Open up the heavens, Lord,
Open up the heavens, Lord.
Open up the heavens, Lord,
Let us sing the song that Jesus saves us.
