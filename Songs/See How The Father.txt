To Jesus be glory forevermore.
To Jesus be glory forevermore.
#1
See How The Father opens the heavens
To honour His Son.
See how the Spirit descends like a dove
Upon His belovèd One.
This the Lamb of God
Who takes away the sins of the world.
Grace has appeared to heal the nations,
Christ has been given to set us free,
To Him be the glory forevermore.
#2
See how the Father opens the heavens,
Revealing His Son.
Angels and elders and saints without number
Worship the risen One.
And with a shout they proclaim,
'Worthy is the Lamb who was slain;
To Him be all power and riches and wisdom,
To Him be all the honour, dominion and praise,
To Him be the glory forevermore.'
#3
Can you hear the Father saying,
'I am so pleased, just look at My Son,
Just look at My Son'?
