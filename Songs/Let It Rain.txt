#1
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain,
Let it rain on every nation.
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain,
Let it rain on every nation.
(Repeat)
#2
Take our hearts as fuel for the fire,
Now is the time to see your power.
Take our prayers as abundant rain,
Open up the floodgates of heaven.
Let the trumpet sound
And the rain come down.
#3
Love rain down, down on me.
Love rain down, down on me.
Love rain down, down on me.
Love rain down on me.
(Repeat)
