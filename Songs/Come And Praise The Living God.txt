Come and praise the living God,
Come and worship, come and worship.
He has made you priest and King,
Come and worship the living God.
#1
We come not to a mountain of fire and smoke,
Not to gloom and darkness or trumpet sound;
We come to the new Jerusalem,
The holy city of God.
#2
By His voice He shakes the earth,
His judgements known throughout theworld.
But we have a city that forever stands,
The holy city of God.
