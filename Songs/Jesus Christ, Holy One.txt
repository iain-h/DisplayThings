What mercies You have poured on me,
With thankfulness I'll sing;
I choose to fix my mind
On all the blessings You have given me.
For You've revealed to me Your grace,
The wonder of the cross;
You've breathed new life to me,
And in Your victory I now stand today.

Jesus Christ, Holy One,
The lifter of our heads,
Through You I come, conquering Son,
To my Father in heaven.
And I'm confident that I belong to You,
As the Spirit testifies.
I shall not fear, fear has no hold,
So I cry 'Abba Father!'
