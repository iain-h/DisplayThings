O magnify the Lord with me,
And let us exalt His name together.
O magnify the Lord with me,
And let us exalt His name together.
#1
I called to the Lord and He answered,
Saved me from all of my trouble;
He delivered me from all my fear,
So I'll rejoice, I'll rejoice!
#2
We will boast about the Lord,
Tell of the things He has done;
Let the whole world hear about it,
And they'll rejoice, they'll rejoice!
#3
We will magnify Jesus together;
We will magnify You, O Lord.
We will magnify Jesus together;
We will magnify You, O Lord.
