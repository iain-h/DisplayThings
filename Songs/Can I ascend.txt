I'm coming up the mountain, Lord;
I'm seeking you and you alone.
I know that I will be transformed,
My heart unveiled before you.
I'm longing for your presence, Lord;
Envelop me within the cloud.
I'm coming up the mountain, Lord,
My heart unveiled before you, I will come.
#1
Can I ascend the hill of the Lord?
Can I stand in that holy place?
There to approach the glory of my God;
Come towards to seek your face.
Purify my heart,
And purify my hands,
For I know it is on holy ground I'll stand.
#2
I'm coming to worship,
I'm coming to bow down,
I'm coming to meet with you.
