#1
Sound the trumpet, strike the drum,
See the King of glory come,
Join the praises rising from the people of the Lord.
Let your voices now be heard,
Unrestrained and unreserved,
Prepare a way for His return,
You people of the Lord.
Sing Jesus is Lord, Jesus is Lord.
Bow down to His authority,
For he has slain the enemy.
Of heav'n and hell he holds the key.
Jesus is Lord, Jesus is Lord.
