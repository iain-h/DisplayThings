It's the blood, it's the blood,
The blood that my Lord shed for me.
It's the blood, it's the blood,
The blood of my Lord set me free.
#1
O the blood of my Saviour,
O the blood of the Lamb,
O the blood of God's only Son
Has paid the price for my sin.
#2
O the blood shed at Calvary,
O the blood spilled for me,
O the blood of God's only Son,
Jesus, your blood set me free.
#3
O the blood from the nail prints,
O the blood from the thorns,
O the blood from the spear in His side
Has given me life evermore.
