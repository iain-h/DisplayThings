#C
Be my life, be my all;
Heart and soul I seek You, Lord.
#1
I Come To Bow Down,
I come to hear You speak.
I wait before You
Where deep can call to deep.
#2
My heart will praise You;
In praises You dwell.
I long to be with You
And come away with You.
#3
Wonder of heaven, joy of my heart;
Strength of my being, I love You.
Rock of salvation, love of my life;
God of all comfort, draw near.
#4
Heart and soul I seek You, Lord;
Heart and soul I seek You, Lord.
