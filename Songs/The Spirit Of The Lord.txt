Proclaiming Jesus, only Jesus.
It is Jesus, Saviour, Healer, and
Baptiser and the mighty King,
The Victor and Deliverer,
He is Lord, He is Lord,
He is Lord.
#1
The Spirit of the Lord,
The sovereign Lord is on me
Because He has anointed me
To preach good news to the poor.
#2
And He has called on me.
To bind up all the broken hearts,
To minister release
To every captivated soul.
#3
Let righteousness arise
And blossom as a garden.
Let praise begin to spring
In every tongue and nation.
