I'll come to the Giver of life,
I'll drink from His well of delights:
I'll yield to His tender embrace,
I'll be to Him an offering of praise.
#1
With His Hands He Made Me,
Breathed His life within me;
With His heart He loved me,
Yet I turned away.
In His love He sought me,
Came to earth to save me;
Punished my rebellion
With His sacrifice.
#2
Here I stand before You,
Needing Your forgiveness,
Thirsting for Your Spirit,
Longing for Your touch.
Let the flame within me
Grow into a fire,
Banish all my darkness
With Your piercing light.
