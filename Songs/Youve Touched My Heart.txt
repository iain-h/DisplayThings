For what is worthy of the King of kings,
But a heart that is satisfied in loving You?
Yours is the song,
Yours is the praise I'll bring,
With a passion for the wonder
Of seeing Your glory here.
#1
You've Touched My Heart
With words of Your mercy
And thoughts of Your beauty.
Your presence, God,
Has captured me now
With the hope of Your glory.
You've opened my eyes to see
You're all that this heart can need.
#2
This song I'll bring
Is my song of love from
A heart that's been broken.
It's what You've done,
For I've been set free by
The life that You've given.
Faithful and holy One,
Forever I live to sing.
