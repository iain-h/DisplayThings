You are my vision, O King of my heart.
Nothing else satisfies, only You, Lord.
You are my best thought by day or by night.
Waking or sleeping, Your presence, my light.
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
#2
You are my wisdom, You are my true word,
I ever with You, and You with me Lord:
You're my great Father, and I'm Your true son
You dwell inside me, together we're one.
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
#3
You are my battle-shield, sword for the fight:
You are my dignity, You're my delight;
You're my soul's shelter and You're my high tower.
Come, raise me heavenward, O Power of my power.
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
#4
I don't want riches or man's empty praise:
You're my inheritance, now and always;
You, and You only, the first in my heart:
High King of heaven, my treasure You are.
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
#5
High King of heaven, when victory's won
May I reach Heaven's joy, O bright Heaven's Son.
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
