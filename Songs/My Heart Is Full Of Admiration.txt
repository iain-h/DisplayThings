All the glory, honour and power belong to You
Belong to You.
Jesus, Saviour, Anointed One I worship You,
I worship You (last time x3)
#1
My heart is full of admiration
For You, my Lord, my God and King.
Your excellence, my inspiration
Your words of grace have made my spirit sing.
#2
You love what's right, and hate all evil,
Therefore Your God sets You on high.
And on Your head pours oil and gladness
While fragrance fills Your royal palaces
#3
Your throne O God, will last forever
Justice will be, Your royal decree,
In majesty, ride out victorious,
For righteousness, truth and humility.
