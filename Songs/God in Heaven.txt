To God in Heaven be the glory
To God in Heaven be the glory
Great things our Savious he has done
And greater things are yet to come

In this world I don't belong
But I'm living it
I've found the words to Heaven's song
Now I'm singing it
Songs of freedom, words of love
Reveal the saving grace of God
The sound of Heaven on this earth, we'll sing
