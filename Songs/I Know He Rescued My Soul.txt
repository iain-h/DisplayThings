My Redeemer lives, my Redeemer lives;
My Redeemer lives, my Redeemer lives.
#1
I Know He Rescued My Soul,
His blood has covered my sin,
I believe, I believe.
My shame He's taken away,
My pain is healed in His name,
I believe, I believe.
I'll raise a banner;
My Lord has conquered the grave.
#2
You lift my burden, I'll rise with You:
I'm dancing on this mountain-top
To see Your kingdom come.
