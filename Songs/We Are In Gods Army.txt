We are in God's army,
We are in the army of the Lord, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We are in God's army,
Glorie, Glorie, Glorie,
The Glorie Company.

The enemy's attacking, convinced he's gaining ground,
But the only voice that he can hear is the one he shouts around;
But we're not fooled by his lies, we know that he is wrong-
We may be weak as soldiers, but as an army we are strong.
#2
The enemy's regrouping, as he tries another plan,
He can't pick off an army but he can pick out a man;
So we'll stay close together, and sing this battle-song-
We may be weak as soldiers, but as an army we are strong.
#3
The enemy's realising that his future's looking poor,
Though he loves single combat, he's already lost the war;
United, not divided, together we belong-
We may be weak as soldiers, but as an army we are strong.
