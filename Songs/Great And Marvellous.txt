Every nation rise and sing
Praises to our glorious King.
Every tongue in one accord
Cry out and confess:
'Jesus is Lord!'
#1
Great And Marvellous are Your deeds, Lord;
Just and true are all of Your ways.
Who would dare to never fear You,
Or bring glory to Your name.
For nothing compares to You.
#2
You are worthy to receive all
Of the glory, honour and power.
By You all things were created
And by You all things are sustained.
For nothing compares to You.
No, nothing compares to You.
#3
'Hallelujah' cry Your servants,
'We will worship' both great and small.
King of all kings, Lord of all lords,
You will reign for evermore.
For nothing compares to You.
No, nothing compares to You.
