Draw me, draw me
To Your sacred place.
Draw me, draw me
Till I see Your face.
#1
Take Me To Your Sacred Place,
How I long to see Your face.
I'll be lost in Your embrace
And be loved, and be loved by You.
#2
Take me where Your glory shines,
Where Your holy fire burns.
Purify this heart of mine,
I surrender my life to You.
