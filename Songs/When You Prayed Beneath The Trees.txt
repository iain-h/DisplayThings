#1
When You Prayed Beneath The Trees,
It was for me, O Lord;
When You cried upon Your knees,
How could it be, O Lord?
When in blood and sweat and tears
You dismissed Your final fears,
When You faced the soldiers' spears,
You stood for me, O Lord.
#2
When their triumph looked complete,
It was for me, O Lord;
When it seemed like Your defeat,
They could not see, O Lord!
When You faced the mob alone
You were silent as a stone,
And a tree became Your throne;
You came for me, O Lord.
#3
When You stumbled up the road,
You walked for me, O Lord,
When You took Your deadly load,
That heavy tree, O Lord;
When they lifted You on high,
And they nailed You up to die,
And when darkness filled the sky,
It was for me, O Lord.
#4
When You spoke with kingly power,
It was for me, O Lord,
In that dread and destined hour,
You made me free, O Lord;
Earth and heaven heard You shout,
Death and hell were put to rout,
For the grave could not hold out;
You are for me, O Lord.
