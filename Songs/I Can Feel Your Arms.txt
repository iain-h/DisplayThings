I Can Feel Your Arms surrounding,
Treasuring my soul.
Draw me ever closer into Your love,
Into Your love.
Lead me to Your place of wonder,
Shower me with grace.
Holy God, forgive my unrighteous ways,
Unrighteous ways.
#2
Oh I love You, Lord,
All I am is Yours,
As Your mercy pours into my heart.
You're my faithful King,
Over everything,
Hear my spirit sing that Jesus is Lord.
