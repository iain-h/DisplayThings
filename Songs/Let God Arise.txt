Let God arise
And let His enemies
Be scattered;
And let those who hate Him
Flee before Him.
Let God arise,
And let His enemies
Be scattered;
And let those who hate Him
Flee away.

(Men)
But let the righteous be glad,
Let them exult before God,
Let them rejoice with gladness,
Building up a highway for the King.
We go in the name of the Lord,
Let the shout go up
In the name of the Lord.
#2
(Women)
The righteous be glad,
Let them exult before God,
O let them rejoice
For the King,
In the name of the Lord.
