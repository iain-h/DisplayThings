I'm alive, 'cos You're alive 
I'm alive, 'cos You're alive 
Breathing life, breathing life through me 
Everything You chose to give 
You gave it all, now I can live 
Be the life, be the life in me 
Jesus You're alive!
#1
My life is built on your promises
Upon Your love and Your holiness 
You're the solid rock on which I stand 
You took my sin and You cleared the debt 
Gave me life when You conquered death 
Risen One, in You I'm born again 
Now death has lost it's hold on me!

Jesus Christ, come alive in me 
Jesus Christ, come alive in me 
Jesus Christ, come alive in me 
Jesus Christ, come alive in me, in me 
Come alive
