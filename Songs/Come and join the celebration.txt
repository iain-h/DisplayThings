Come and join the celebration,
It’s a very special day;
Come and share our jubilation,
There’s a new King born today!

See the shepherds
Hurry down to Bethlehem;
Gaze in wonder
At the Son of God who lay before them.
#2
Wise men journey,
Led to worship by a star,
Kneel in homage,
Bringing precious gifts from lands afar, so
#3
‘God is with us,’
‘round the world the message bring;
He is with us,
‘Welcome!’ all the bells on earth are pealing.
