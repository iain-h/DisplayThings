And we'll be a dancing generation
Dancing  because  of  your  great  mercy, Lord
Your great mercy, Lord
And  we'll be a shouting generation
Shouting because of your great glory, Lord
Your great glory, Lord
#1
Your mercy taught us how to dance
To celebrate with all we have
And we'll dance to thank you for mercy
#2
Your glory taught us how to shout
To  lift your name in all the earth
And we'll shout to the praise of your glory

It's the overflow, of a forgiven soul
And now we've seen you, God
Our hearts cannot stay silent
