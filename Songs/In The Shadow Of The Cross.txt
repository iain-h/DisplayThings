And nothing I can do
Could add to all You've done,
So let my soul be satisfied.
As I receive Your favour,
I will overcome.
So in my life be glorified.
#1
In The Shadow Of The Cross,
Let everything fall into place again.
Jesus Christ, my sacrifice,
How I need to find Your grace again.
#2
Jesus Christ, my perfect Priest,
How You understand my weaknesses.
Thank You for Your gift to me:
Through Your sufferings I now
Possess this peace.
