As high as the heavens are above the earth,
So high is the measure of your great love,
As far as the east is from the west,
So far have you taken our sins from us.
(Repeat)
#1
The cross has said it all,
The cross has said it all.
I can't deny what you have shown,
The cross speaks of a God of love;
There displayed for all to see,
Jesus Christ, our only hope,
A message of the Father's heart,
'Come, my children, come on home.'
#2
The cross has said it all,
The cross has said it all.
I never recognised your touch,
Until I met you at the cross.
We are fallen, dust to dust,
How could you do this for us?
Son of God shed precious blood,
Who can comprehend this love?
#3
How high, how wide, how deep.
How high, how wide, how deep.
How high, how wide, how deep.
How high, how wide, how deep.
How high!
