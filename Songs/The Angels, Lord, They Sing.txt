Holy, Holy, Holy,
Lord our God,
Who was and is and is to come.
(Repeat)
#1
The angels, Lord, they sing
Around Your throne;
And we will join their song:
Praise You alone.
(Repeat)
#2
The living creatures, Lord,
Speak endless praise;
And joining at Your throne,
We'll sing their sweet refrain.
(Repeat)
#3
The elders, Lord,they fall
Before Your throne;
Our hearts we humbly bow
To You alone.
(Repeat)
