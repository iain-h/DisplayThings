You are my God, You are my God.
As long as I have breath I will sing of Your greatness.
You are my source, my all in all,
My first love, the One I love,
You are my God.
#1
Every Breath I Breathe comes from You,
I'll never take it for granted.
All that I have, all I've ever needed,
You have provided.
#2
You know when I sit, You know when I rise,
You know my thoughts completely.
You hem me in before and behind:
Such love is hard to describe.
#3
Precious to me are Your thoughts, O God;
No wisdom or knowledge is greater.
Praise be to You, Name above all names:
Who reigns forever, ever and ever, (x3)
Who reigns forevermore.
You reign forever, ever and ever, (x3)
You reign forevermore.
