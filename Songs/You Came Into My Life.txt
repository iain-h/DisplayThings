While today is still today
I'll live just for Your praise,
A living sacrifice;
Holding out to be
Faithful unto You,
So in my life be glorified,
I pray.
#1
You Came Into My Life,
A Saviour to my soul;
You set a hope within this heart of mine.
You said that I am Yours,
That You will never leave me.
Now I surrender all I am to You.
#2
I will never know why You chose me, God,
But You did.
I will never know why You took that cross,
But You did, yes, You did.
#3
In You, O Lord, I trust,
In You, O Lord, I live;
Do not let me stray from Your commands.
Guide me in Your way,
Protect me in Your truth,
Teach me what it means to follow You.
