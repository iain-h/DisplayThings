Lord, here I am, amazed again,
That You would die to save a friend.
You clear my sin and pay the cost,
So on my knees I'll stay,
At the foot of the cross.
#1
Praises,
For all that You've done I'll sing praises,
For sending Your Son who would save me,
Pouring out grace at the cross
Where You died for me.
Mercies,
Through all of my life I've seen mercies,
Through hardship and strife You are with me,
By my side, You are good,
So good to me.
#2
Through Your death You brought me life,
Took my shame, clothed me in white.
#3
Worship,
Day after day I will worship,
For glory and grace, and for goodness,
With all of my life I will be Your living praise.
And Jesus,
I'll always look unto Jesus,
For guidance and strength and my focus,
Trying to live how You want Your child to be.
