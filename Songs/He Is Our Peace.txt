He is our peace,
Who has broken down every wall;
He is our peace,
He is our peace.
He is our peace,
Who has broken down every wall;
He is our peace,
He is our peace.

Cast all your cares on Him,
For He cares for you;
He is our peace,
He is our peace.
Cast all your cares on Him,
For He cares for you;
He is our peace,
He is our peace.
