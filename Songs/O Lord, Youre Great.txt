Allelu, alleluia, praise You, Lord.
Alleluia, praise You, Lord.
Alleluia, praise You, Lord.
(Repeat)
#1
O Lord, you're great, You are fabulous,
We love You more than any words can sing, sing, sing.
O Lord, You're great, You are so generous,
You lavish us with gifts when we don't deserve a thing.
#2
O Lord, You're great, You are so powerful,
You hold the mighty universe in Your hand, hand, hand.
O Lord, You're great, You are so beautiful,
You've poured out Your love on this undeserving land.
