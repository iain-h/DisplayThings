#C
Surely Our God is the God of gods,
And the Lord of kings,
The revealer of mysteries.
(Repeat)
#1
He changes the times and the seasons,
He gives rhythm to the tides;
He knows what is hidden
In the darkest of places,
Brings the shadows into His light.
#2
I'll praise You always, my Father,
You are Lord of heaven and earth.
You hide Your secrets
From the 'wise' and the learnèd,
And reveal them to this, Your child.
#3
Thank You for sending Your only Son,
We may know the mystery of God;
He opens the treasures
Of wisdom and knowledge
To the humble, not to the proud.
