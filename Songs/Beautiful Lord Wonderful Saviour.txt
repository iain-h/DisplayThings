Beautiful Lord, wonderful Saviour,
I know for sure, all of my days are
Held in Your hand,
Crafted into Your perfect plan.
You gently call me into Your presence,
Guiding me by Your Holy Spirit.
Teach me, dear Lord, to live all of my life
Through Your eyes.
#2
I'm captured by Your holy calling,
Set me apart.
I know You're drawing me to Yourself;
Lead me, Lord, I pray.
#3
Take me, mould me, use me, fill me;
I give my life to the Potter's hand.
Call me, guide me, lead me, walk beside me;
I give my life to the Potter's hand.
