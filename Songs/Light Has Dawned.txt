We proclaim him king of kings,
We lift high His name.
Heaven and earth shall bow at His feet
When He comes to reign.
#1
Light has dawned that ever shall blaze;
Darkness flees away.
Christ the light has shone in our hearts,
Turning night to day.
#2
Saviour of the world is He,
Heaven's King come down.
Judgement, love and mercy meet
At His thorny crown.
#3
Life has sprung from hearts of stone,
By the Spirit's breath.
Hell shall let her captives go,
Life has conquered death.
#4
Blood has flowed that cleanses from sin,
God His love has proved.
Men may mock and demons may rage,
We shall not be moved!
