You shall go out with joy
And be led forth with peace,
And the mountains and the hills
Shall break forth before you.
There'll be shouts of joy
And the trees of the field
Shall clap, shall clap their hands.
And the trees of the field
Shall clap their hands,
And the trees of the field
Shall clap their hands,
And the trees of the field
Shall clap their hands,
And you'll go out with joy.
