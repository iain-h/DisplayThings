#C
On Christ the solid Rock I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.
#1
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.
#2
When darkness veils His lovely face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil.
#3
His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the 'whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.
#4
When he shall come with trumpet sound,
O may I then in him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.
