I will give you all my worship,
I will give you all my praise,
You alone I long to worship,
You alone are worthy of my praise.
#1
I will worship, I will worship
With all of my heart, with all of my heart
I will praise You, I will praise you
With all of my strength, all my strength
I will seek You, I will seek you
All of my days, all of my days
I will follow, I will follow
All of your ways all your ways
#2
I will bow down, I will bow down
Hail You as King, hail you as King
I will serve You, I will serve you
Give you everything, give you everything.
I will lift up, I will lift up
My eyes to your throne, my eyes to your throne
I will trust You, I will trust you
I will trust you alone, trust in you alone
