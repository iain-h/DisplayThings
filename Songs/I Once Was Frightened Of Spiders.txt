I once was frightened of spiders,
I once was frightened of the dark;
I once was frightened of many, manythings,
Especially things that barked.
But now I'm asking Jesus
To help these fears to go,
'Cause I don't want them to be part of me,
No, no, no, no, no.

I once was frightened by thunder,
And frightened by lightning too;
I once was frightened by many, many things
That crashed and banged and blew.
But now I'm asking Jesus
To help these fears to go,
'Cause I don't want them to be part of me,
No, no, no, no, no.
