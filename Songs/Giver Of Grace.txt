Oh, You are good, so good to me.
Yes, You are good, so good to me.
Oh, You are good, so good to me.
Yes, You are good, so good to me
#1
Giver Of Grace,
How priceless Your love for me,
Purer than silver, more costly than gold.
Giver of life, all that I'll ever need,
Strength for my body and food for my soul.
#2
Giver of hope, Rock of salvation,
Tower of refuge, yet there in my pain.
Now I'm secure, loved for eternity,
Showered with blessings
And lavished with grace.
#3
I've never known a love
So perfect in its faithfulness;
It lifts me up to the highest place.
A glimpse of heaven
And a taste of my inheritance,
I know that one day I'll be with You.
