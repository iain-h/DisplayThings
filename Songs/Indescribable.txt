From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
Creation's revealing Your majesty
From the colours of fall to the fragrance of spring
Every creature unique in the song that it sings
All exclaiming
#2
Indescribable, uncontainable You placed the stars in the sky
And You know them by name You are amazing, God
All powerful, untamable awestruck, we fall to our knees
As we humbly proclaim You are amazing, God
#3
Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow?
Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night?
None can fathom
#4
Indescribable, uncontainable You placed the stars in the sky
And You know them by name You are amazing, God
Incomparable, unchangeable You see the depths of my heart
And You love me the same You are amazing God
