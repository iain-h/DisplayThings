For such a moment we have been born.
We're gonna rise up,
Take this world by storm.
Let evil tremble,
We come in His name.
Our God is with us,
We're dangerous people.
#1
Here we are, Lord,
More weak than strong;
Still believing, still pressing on.
Make us ready
With hearts that are brave.
We will silence the lies of this age.
#2
All God's heroes failed as we do,
Sometimes doubting all that is true.
Yet He calls us great people of faith,
Working through us as history is made.
