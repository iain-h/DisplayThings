And I worship You,
I give my life to You,
I fall down on my knees.
Yes, I worship You,
I give my life to You,
I fall down on my knees.
#1
I give You all the honour
And praise that's due Your name,
For You are the King of glory,
The Creator of all things.
#2
As Your Spirit moves upon me now
You meet my deepest need,
And I lift my hands up to Your throne,
Your mercy I've received.
#3
You have broken chains that bound me,
You've set this captive free;
I will lift my voice to praise Your name
For all eternity.
