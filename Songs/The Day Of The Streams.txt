The day of the streams is over,
The time of the river is here.
(Repeat x4)
#1
I hear the sound of a mighty river,
Of rushing water running free
To every land, through every border,
Flowing now across this earth.
There is a time I know is coming,
When all God's people join as one;
They will become a great awakening,
Bringing life to all the world.
And the river is flowing,
Getting wider and wider,
Deeper and deeper
As it flows from the throne;
And the leaves on the trees
Are for the healing of the nations,
It's as clear as crystal,
It's the water of life.
