#1
He has been given a name above all names,
In earth and heaven, let all creation claim
That Jesus Christ is King, and Lord of all.
He is the Victor over satan's reign,
His blood has triumphed over sin and shame,
Jesus Christ is King and Lord of all.
#2
He is the likeness of Jehovah,
Through whom the world was made.
By His word the universe is sustained,
Every power is subject to His name.
#3
The name of Jesus in victory will resound,
In every nation let the good news sound:
Jesus Christ is King, and Lord of all.
