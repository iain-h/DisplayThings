I went to the enemy's camp
And I took back what he stole from me,
I took back what he stole from me,
I took back what he stole from me.
I went to the enemy's camp
And I took back what he stole from me.
He's under my feet, he's under my feet,
He's under my feet, he's under my feet,
He's under my feet, he's under my feet,
Satan is under my feet.
