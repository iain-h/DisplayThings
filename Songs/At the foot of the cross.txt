#C
I will wait here at the cross. (x4)
#1
At the foot of the cross
Where I kneel in adoration,
And I lay my burdens down
I exchange all my sin
For the promise of salvation,
And Your name across my brow.
#2
At the foot of the cross
I give up my vain ambition,
And I leave my selfish pride.
In the peace that is there
Will You restore my vision
In all the places I am blind?
#3
At the foot of the cross
There is healing for this nation,
There is rest for those who wait;
And the love that we find
Is the hope of all creation,
We are stunned by what You gave.
#4
We will wait at the cross,
A hungry generation,
With our broken hearts and lives.
Will You hear, will You come,
Will You fill our desperation?
O God, let this be the time.
#B
We will wait here at the cross. (x4)
