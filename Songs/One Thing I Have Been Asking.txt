You're the desire of my heart,
And You are all that I want;
You're the desire of my heart,
And You are all that I want.
#1
One Thing I Have Been Asking,
One thing I am looking for:
To see Your glory and beauty,
To know Your presence, Lord.
#2
You have all my attention,
You are the One I'm living for;
In You I find satisfaction,
You are mine and I am Yours.
#3
I am wanting You,
I am needing You much more, Lord.
You have won my heart,
You've given me all that You've got,
Your love was demonstrated on the cross.
Thank You, Lord!
