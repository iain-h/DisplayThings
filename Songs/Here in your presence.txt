Standing before you,
We love and adore you, O Lord,
There is none like you.
#1
Here in your presence,
Beholding your glory,
Bowing in reverence
We worship you only.
#2
Name above all names,
Beholding your glory,
To Jesus, our Saviour
Our lives we surrender.
#3
Worthy of glory,
Worthy of honour,
We give you blessing,
Glory and power.
