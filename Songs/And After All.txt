Unashamed and unafraid,
I will choose to wear Your name,
In a world so full of hate,
I will always live Your way.
#1
And after all,
Everything I once held dear
Just proved to be so vain.
To lose it all,
And find a Friend who's always near
Could only be my gain.
And when I think of what You've done for me,
To bring me to the Father's side:
#2
Could it be
That You should put on human flesh,
Your glory laid aside?
Bruised for me,
Majesty upon the cross,
Forsaken and despised.
When I think of what it cost for You,
To bring me to the Father's side:
#3
I know some will say it's foolishness:
You can't make a blind man see.
But I know that there is power in the cross
To save those who believe.

Unashamed and unafraid,
I will choose to wear Your name,
In a world so full of hate,
I will always live Your way.
Unashamed and unafraid,
I will love You all my days,
I don't care what people say,
I'm unashamed and unafraid.
