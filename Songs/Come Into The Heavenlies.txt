Come into the heavenlies
And sing the song the angels sing,
Worthy, worthy.
Come into the heavenlies,
And sing the song the angels sing,
Worthy, worthy.

Worthy is the Lamb.
Worthy is the Lamb.
Worthy is the Lamb.
Worthy is the Lamb.
#3
Worthy of blessing and honour,
Worthy of glory and power,
Worthy is the Lamb.
