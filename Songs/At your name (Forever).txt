Lord of all the earth we'll shout your name, shout your name
Filling up the skies with endless praise, endless praise
YAHWEH, YAHWEH, We love to shout your name, O Lord

At Your name, mountains shake and crumble
At Your name, the oceans roll and tumble
At Your name, angels will bow
The earth will rejoice, your people cry out
#2
At Your name, the morning breaks in glory
At Your name, creation sings your story
At Your name, angels will bow
The earth will rejoice, your people cry out

At Your name, angels will bow
The earth will rejoice, your people cry out
