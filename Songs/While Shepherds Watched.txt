While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground,
The angel of the Lord came down
And glory shone around.
#2
'Fear not' said he, for mighty dread
Had seized their troubled mind;
'Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind.
#3
'To you in David's town this day
Is born of David's line
A Saviour, who is Christ the Lord,
And this shall be the sign.
#4
'The heavenly babe you there shall find
To human view displayed,
All meanly wrapped in swaddling bands,
And in a manger laid.'
#5
Thus spake the seraph; and forthwith
Appeared a shining throng
Of angels, praising God, who thus
Addressed their joyful song:
#6
'All glory be to God on high
And on the earth be peace;
Goodwill henceforth from heaven to men
Begin and never cease.'
