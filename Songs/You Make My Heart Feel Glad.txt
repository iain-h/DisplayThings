You make my heart feel glad.
You make my heart feel glad.
Jesus, You bring me joy;
You make my heart feel glad.
#1
Lord, Your love brings healing and a peace into my heart,
I want to give myself in praise to You.
Though I've been through heartache
You have understood my tears,
O Lord, I will give thanks to You.
#2
When I look around me, and I see the life You made
All creation shouts aloud in praise;
I realise Your greatness,
How majestic is Your name,
O Lord, I love You more each day.
