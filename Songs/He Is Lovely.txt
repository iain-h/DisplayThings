He is lovely, He is Holy,
Gave supremely, that all men may see.
He is gentle, tender-hearted,
Risen Saviour, He is God.

Master, maker, life creator,
Come and dwell in me,
That my heart may know
Your tender mercy.
Shine through me that all may see
Your love so full and free;
And I'll declare Your praise
Through endless ages.
