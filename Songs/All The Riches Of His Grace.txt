All the riches of His grace,
All the fulness of His blessings,
All the sweetness of His love
He gives to you,
He gives to me.

Oh, the blood of Jesus,
Oh, the blood of Jesus,
Oh, the blood of Jesus,
It washes white as snow.
#3
Oh, the word of Jesus,
Oh, the word of Jesus,
Oh, the word of Jesus,
It cleanses white as snow.

Oh, the love of Jesus,
Oh, the love of Jesus,
Oh, the love of Jesus,
It makes His Body whole.
