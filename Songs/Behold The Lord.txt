#1
Behold the Lord upon His throne;
His face is shining like the sun.
With eyes blazing fire, and feet glowing bronze,
His voice like mighty water roars.
Holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.
Holy, holy, we stand in awe of you.
#2
The first, the last, the living One,
Laid down His life for all the world.
Behold, he now lives for evermore,
And holds the keys of death and hell.
Holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.
Holy, holy, we bow before your throne.
#3
So let our praises ever ring
To Jesus Christ, our glorious King.
All heaven and earth resound as we cry:
'Worthy is the Son of God!'
Holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.
Holy, holy, we fall down at your feet.
