And oh, how I need You.
Jesus, I need You.
You are the One who satisfies,
You are the One who satisfies.
#1
Nothing in this world,
No treasure man could buy,
Could take the place of drawing near to You.
There's nothing I want more
Than to spend my days with You,
Dwelling in Your secret place of praise.
#2
So place within my heart
A fire that burns for You,
That waters cannot quench
Nor wash away.
And let that fire blaze
Through all eternity,
Where one day I shall see You face to face.
