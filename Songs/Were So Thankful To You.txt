And we say thank You, Lord.
We say thank You, Lord.
We say thank You for what You havedone.
And we say thank You, Lord.
We say thank You, Lord.
We say thank You
For the things You have done.
#1
We're so thankful to You,
We're so grateful for the things You've done,
That You died for us on the cross-
Such a painful death,
That You paid the price for us,
You paid the price for us.
#2
It's so wonderful that You rose,
Victorious over death and hell.
All authority is now Yours,
And the Comforter
You have sent in fulness to us,
You have come to us.
