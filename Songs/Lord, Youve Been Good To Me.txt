#C
New every morning is Your love,
Filled with compassion from above.
Grace and forgiveness full and free,
Lord, You've been good to me.
#1
Lord, You've Been Good To Me
All my life, all my life;
Your loving kindness never fails.
I will remember all You have done,
Bring from my heart thanksgiving songs.
#2
So, may each breath I take
Be for You, Lord, only You,
Giving You back the life I owe.
Love so amazing, mercy so free.
Lord, You've been good,
So good to me.
