May we be a shining light to the nations,
A shining light to the peoples of the earth;
Till the whole world sees the glory of Your name,
May Your pure light shine through us.

May we bring a word of hope to the nations,
A word of life to the peoples of the earth;
Till the whole world knows there's salvation through Your name,
May Your mercy flow through us.

May we be a healing balm to the nations,
A healing balm to the peoples of the earth;
Till the whole world knows the power of Your name,
May Your healing flow through us.

May we sing a song of joy to the nations,
A song of praise to the peoples of the earth;
Till the whole world rings with the praises of Your name,
May Your song be sung through us.
#5
May Your kingdom come to the nations,
Your will be done in the peoples of the earth;
Till the whole world knows that Jesus Christ is Lord,
May Your kingdom come in us,
May Your kingdom come in us,
May Your kingdom come on earth.
