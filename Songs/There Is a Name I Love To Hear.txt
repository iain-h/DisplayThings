O, how I love the saviour's name,
O, how I love the Saviour's name,
O, how I love the Saviour's name,
The sweetest name on earth.
#1
There is a name I love to hear,
I love to speak its worth;
It sounds like music in my ear,
The sweetest name on earth.
#2
It tells me of a Saviour's love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood,
The sinner's perfect plea.
#3
It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe;
Who in my sorrow bears a part
That none can bear below.
#4
It bids my trembling heart rejoice,
It dries each rising tear;
It tells me in a still, small voice
To trust and never fear.
#5
Jesus, the name I love so well,
The name I love to hear!
No saint on earth its worth can tell,
No heart conceive how dear!
