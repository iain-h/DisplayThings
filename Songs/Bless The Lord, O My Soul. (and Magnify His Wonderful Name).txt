Bless the Lord, O my soul
And magnify his wonderful name
For the glory of the Lord
Is mine forever
Jesus is ever the same.
For the Lord has set me free
He's given me liberty
To tell the world that Jesus is mine
And he's given me the wine
To make my heart rejoice
And the oil to make my face to shine.
