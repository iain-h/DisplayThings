We serve a God of miracles,
You heal the sick and open blinded eyes;
We serve a God of miracles,
The demons flee the moment you arise,
Arise, and show yourself strong,
Arise, arise, and show yourself strong.
(Repeat)
#1
We serve a God of power,
We serve a God of might,
We serve a God of signs and wonders;
We serve a God of power,
We serve a God of might.
You speak and all creation thunders.
