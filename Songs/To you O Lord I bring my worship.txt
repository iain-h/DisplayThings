Holy, holy, holy, holy.
Holy, holy, holy, holy.
#1
To you, O Lord, I bring my worship,
An offering of love to you.
Surrounded in your holy presence,
All I can say is that I love you.
#2
Give ear to the groaning in my spirit.
Hear the crying in my heart.
Release my soul to freely worship,
For I was made to give you honour.
