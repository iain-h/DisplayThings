Holy, I stand before You,
Truly, I am blameless in Your sight.
Righteous, a royal robe I don't deserve,
Yet You choose to clothe me still,
Precious mercy.
#1
Thank You, Lord, For Your Love To Me.
By Your truth You have set me free.
Through the cross I can enter in.
What seemed impossible till I let You
Wash away my sin,
Take away all shame
By the life-giving blood
Of Jesus, my Redeemer.
#2
Such mercy, such grace,
Such kindness to save
Even a sinner like me.
I'll love You, I'll serve You,
I'll praise You forever,
Thank You, Lord, for Your love to me.
