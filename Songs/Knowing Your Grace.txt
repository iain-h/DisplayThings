#1
Knowing Your Grace
Has set me free, Lord.
I'm seeking Your face;
I feel Your pleasure,
Your joy in the ones
You have chosen by name.
You've lifted my burdens
And cast off my shame.
#2
Feeling Your touch
Gives me such peace, Lord.
I love You so much,
I know You'll lead me.
Wherever I go I'll be under Your wing,
For I am a child of the King.
#3
You will finish the work You've begun in me,
I'm adopted, a son in Your family!
You've drawn me with kindness and love
Into this holy place.
#4
What can I say?
Your lavish mercy
Turned night into day -
My guilt has gone now.
Forever I'll stand in Your presence and sing,
For I am a child of the King.
