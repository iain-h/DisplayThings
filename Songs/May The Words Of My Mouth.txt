For this is what I'm glad to do,
It's time to live a life of love
That pleases You.
And I will give my all to You,
Surrender everything I have and follow You,
I'll follow You.
#1
May the words of my mouth,
And the thoughts of my heart
Bless Your name, bless Your name, Jesus:
And the deeds of the day,
And the truth in my ways,
Speak of You, speak of You, Jesus.
#2
Lord, will You be my vision,
Lord, will You be my guide:
Be my hope, be my light, and the way?
And I'll look not for riches,
Nor praises on earth,
Only You'll be the first of my heart.
#3
I will follow, I will follow You. (x4)
