O, The Love Of God Is Boundless,
Perfect, causeless, full and free!
Doubts have vanished, fears are groundless,
Now I know that love to me.
Love, the source of all my blessing,
Love that set itself on me.
Love that gave the sinless Victim,
Love told out at Calvary.
#2
O, the cross of Christ is wondrous!
There I learn God's heart to me;
'Midst the silent, deepening darkness
'God is light' I also see.
Holy claims of justice finding
Full expression in that scene;
Light and love alike are telling
What His woe and suffering means.
#3
O, the sight of heaven is glorious!
Man in righteousness is there.
Once the victim, now victorious,
Jesus lives in glory fair!
Him, who met the claims of glory
And the need of ruined man
On the cross, O wondrous story!
God has set at His right hand.
#4
O, what rest of soul in seeing
Jesus on His Father's throne!
Yes, what peace for ever flowing
From God's rest in His own Son!
Gazing upward into heaven,
Reading glory in His face,
Knowing that 'tis He, once given
On the cross to take my place.
