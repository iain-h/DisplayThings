For he who promised is faithful,
For he who promised is faithful,
Is faithful to me.

We have a great priest
Over the house of God.
So let us draw near to God
With a sincere heart,
In full assurance,
Assurance of our faith,
Having our hearts touched
To cleanse us from our guilt.
#2
Give me a pure heart,
Holding to your hope,
The hope I profess, Lord,
Lead me in your way;
Be now my strength, Lord,
And all of my trust, Lord,
I will fear no one,
For you are with me.
