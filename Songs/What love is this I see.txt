Now I am truly free
Your love amazes me
I see your hands your feet
The price you paid for me
King of Calvary
#1
What love is this I see
You gave your life for me
Shed blood to set me free
Thank you for your blood
Thank you for your blood
#2
How great this sacrifice
Your death to me means life
From darkness into light
Thank you for your blood
Thank you for your blood
