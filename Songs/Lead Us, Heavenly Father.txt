Lead Us, Heavenly Father, lead us
Through this world's tempestuous sea;
Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us -
You our only help and plea;
Here possessing every blessing
If our God our Father be.
#2
Saviour, by Your grace restore us,
All our weaknesses are plain;
You have lived on earth before us,
You have felt our grief and pain:
Tempted, taunted, yet undaunted,
From the depths You rose again.
#3
Spirit of our God, descending,
Fill our hearts with holy peace;
Love with every passion blending,
Pleasure that can never cease:
Thus provided, pardoned, guided,
Ever shall our joys increase.
