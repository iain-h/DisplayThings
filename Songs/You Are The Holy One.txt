We exalt Your name,
High and mighty One of Israel,
We exalt Your name.
Lead us on to war,
In the power of Your name.
We exalt Your name,
The Name above all names,
Our victorious King,
We exalt Your name.
#1
You are the Holy one,
The Lord Most High.
You reign in majesty,
You reign on high.
#2
You are the Worthy One
Lamb that was slain.
You bought us with Your blood,
And with You we'll reign.
#3
You are the King of kings,
The Lord of lords;
All men will bow to You,
Before Your throne.
