Nothing shall separate us from the love of God.
Nothing shall separate us from the love of God.
#1
God did not spare His only Son,
Gave him to save us all.
Sin's price was met by Jesus' death
And heaven's mercy falls.
#2
Up from the grave Jesus was raised
To sit at God's right hand;
Pleading our cause in heaven's courts,
Forgiven we can stand.
#3
Now by God's grace we have embraced
A life set free from sin;
We shall deny all that destroys
Our union with him.
