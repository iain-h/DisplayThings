I will live for You,
Walking in Your way,
Lifting high Your name,
Holding close the cross.
Not in words alone,
But in what I do,
I will live my life for You.
#1
How Can I Repay You, Lord,
For all You've done for me?
Nothing I can say or do
Will ever be enough.
#2
Dear Lord, Your heart is drawing me,
A calling from Your throne.
And in my brokenness I come
And whisper to You, Lord.
#3
It's not by works, but by Your grace,
I'll never earn Your love.
You loved me first, You'll love me last,
Your cross, my only hope.
