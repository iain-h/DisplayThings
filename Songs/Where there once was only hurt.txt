He's turned my mourning
Into dancing again,
He's lifted my sorrow.
I can't stay silent,
I must sing for His joy has come.
(Repeat)
#1
Where there once was only hurt,
He gave His healing hand.
Where there once was only pain,
He brought comfort like a friend.
I feel the sweetness of His love
Piercing my darkness.
I see the bright and morning sun
As it ushers in His joyful gladness.
#2
His anger lasts for a moment in time;
But His favour is here
And will be on me for all my lifetime.
