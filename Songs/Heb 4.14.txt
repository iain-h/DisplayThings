Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.

For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathise with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are yet was without sin. 
#3
Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
