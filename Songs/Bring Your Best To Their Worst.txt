Bring your best to their worst,	(All)
Bring Your peace to their pain,
God of love, heal Your people.
#1
That none who cry aloud may cry in vain:	(Leader)
#2
That those who fear may never walk alone:
#3
That those near death may see the light of day:
#4
That guilty folk may find themselves forgiven:
#5
That those who doubt may find a deeper faith:
#6
That broken folk may know they will be whole:
