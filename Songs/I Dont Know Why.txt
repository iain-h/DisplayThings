#C
All I know is I find mercy;
All my shame You take from me.
All I know, Your cross has power,
And the blood You shed cleanses me.
#1
I Don't Know Why, I can't see how
Your precious blood could cleanse me now;
When all this time I've lived a lie,
With no excuse, no alibi.
#2
It's way beyond what I can see,
How anyone could die for me.
So undeserved, this precious grace;
You've won my heart, I'll seek Your face.
