Your love looks after me,
It never fails.
Your word takes care of me,
And keeps my mind on You.

And keeps my mind on You.

You are majestic
Through all the earth;
I am Your servant
For the rest of my days.
#3
You are magnificent,
The God of glory;
I'm going to worship You
For the rest of my days,
For the rest of my days,
For the rest of my days.
