Behold, he comes riding on the clouds,
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call;
Lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee,
Out of Zion's hill salvation comes.

These are the days of Elijah,
Declaring the word of the Lord;
And these are the days of your servant, Moses,
Righteousness being restored.
And though these are days of great trial,
Of famine and darkness and sword,
Still we are the voice in the desert crying,
'Prepare ye the way of the Lord.'
#2
These are the days of Ezekiel,
The dry bones becoming as flesh;
And these are the days of your servant, David,
Rebuilding a temple of praise.
These are the days of the harvest,
The fields are as white in the world,
And we are the labourers in your vineyard,
Declaring the work of the Lord.
