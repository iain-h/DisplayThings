You have come to us,
Your presence has filled this place.
We will draw near to You,
We come, Lord, to seek Your face.
#1
Jesus, Jesus,
Son of God, Son of man,
Friend of sinners, gift of God.
Jesus, Jesus,
Light of life, Lord of all,
Full of grace and truth.
#2
Jesus, Jesus,
My heart aches, my soul waits,
For Your healing, Lord, I pray.
Jesus, Jesus,
Mighty God, holy Child,
Name above all names.
#3
Jesus, Jesus,
Son of God, Son of Man,
My soul thirsts for You.
