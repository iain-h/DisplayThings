And I'm lifted into Your presence,
Lifted into Your arms of love.
Lifted into Your presence,
Now has my soul found rest,
Now has my soul found rest.
#1
There Is A Passion deep in my heart
To know You, Jesus.
There is a hunger deep in my soul
Only You can satisfy.
I hear You calling, drawing me closer,
I can't resist Your grace.
Almighty power and love so free,
Draw me to Your side.
#2
I see Your face,
I feel Your touch;
Receive Your love,
I worship You.
(Repeat)
