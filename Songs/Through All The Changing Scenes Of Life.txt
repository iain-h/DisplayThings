#1
Through All The Changing Scenes Of Life,
I z trouble and in joy,
The praises of my God shall still
My heart and tongue employ.
#2
Of His deliverance I will boast,
Till all that are distressed
From my example comfort take,
And charm their griefs to rest.
#3
O magnify the Lord with me,
With me exalt His name;
When in distress to Him I called,
He to my rescue came.
#4
The hosts of God encamp around
The dwellings of the just;
Deliverance He affords to all
Who on His succour trust.
#5
O make but trial of His love;
Experience will decide
How blest are they, and only they,
Who in His truth confide.
#6
Fear Him, ye saints, and you will then
Have nothing else to fear;
Make you His service your delight;
Your wants shall be His care.
#A
