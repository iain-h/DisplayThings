And I cry holy, holy is the Lord,
Holy is the Lord most high.
And I cry holy, holy is the Lord,
Holy, is the Lord most high.
#1
I See The Lord,
And He is high and lifted up,
And His train fills the temple.
I see You, Lord,
And You are high and lifted up,
And Your train fills the temple.
#2
I see Your holiness,
And light surrounds Your throne;
Who am I to come before You?
But now my guilt is gone,
My sins are washed away,
Through Your blood I come.
#3
Who am I that I should gain the Father's love?
Now my eyes have seen the King.
Touch my lips that I may tell of all You've done:
Fill my heart I cry,
Be glorified!
