He has risen, he has risen,
He has risen, Jesus is alive.
#1
When the life flowed from His body,
Seemed like Jesus' mission failed.
But His sacrifice accomplished,
Victory over sin and hell.
#2
In the grave God did not leave him,
For His body to decay;
Raised to life, the great awakening,
Satan's pow'r he overcame.
#3
If there were no resurrection,
We ourselves could not be raised;
But the Son of God is living,
So our hope is not in vain.
#4
When the Lord rides out of heaven,
Mighty angels at His side,
They will sound the final trumpet,
From the grave we shall arise.
#5
He has given life immortal,
We shall see him face to face;
Through eternity we'll praise him,
Christ the champion of our faith.
