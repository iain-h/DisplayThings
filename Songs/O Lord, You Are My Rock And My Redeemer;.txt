O Lord, You are my rock and my redeemer;
My song, You are the Strength of my life.
O Lord, You are the Shepherd of Your people;
You keep us always walking in Your light.
#1
You brought me out of darkness,
You took away my shame;
You broke the chains that bound me,
I praise Your name!
#2
You carry all my sorrows,
You carry all my pain;
You fill me with Your Spirit,
I praise Your name!
