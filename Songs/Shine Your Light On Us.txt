Shine Your Light On Us
That all may see Your goodness.
Shine Your face on us
That all may see Your glory.
#1
Answer me when I call.
You are my only prayer.
When darkness is all around
I know You will be there.
#2
Many are asking,
Who can show us something real?
Longing for hope
Beyond the pain of what they feel.
So I will go down on my knees and say:
#3
I wanna be close to You,
That my life would tell Your story.
I wanna be one with You,
Changed by the light of Your glory.
