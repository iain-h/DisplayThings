#1
To Him We Come -
Jesus Christ our Lord,
God's own living Word,
His dear Son:
In Him there is no east and west,
In Him all nations shall be blest;
To all He offers peace and rest -
Loving Lord!
#2
In Him we live -
Christ our strength and stay,
Life and Truth and Way,
Friend divine:
His power can break the chains of sin,
Still all life's storms without, within,
Help us the daily fight to win -
Living Lord!
#3
For Him we go -
Soldiers of the cross,
Counting all things loss,
Him to know;
Going to every land and race,
Preaching to all redeeming grace,
Building His church in every place -
Conquering Lord!
#4
With Him we serve -
His the work we share
With saints everywhere,
Near and far;
One in the task that faith requires,
One in the zeal that never tires,
One in the hope His love inspires -
Coming Lord!
#5
Onward we go -
Faithful, bold and true,
Called His will to do
Day by day
Till, at the last, with joy we'll see
Jesus in glorious majesty;
Live with Him through eternity -
Reigning Lord!
