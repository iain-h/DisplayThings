#1
(men and women in canon)
WE DECLARE THAT THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS HERE,
We declare that the kingdom of God is here,
Among you, among you.
#2
The blind see, the deaf hear,
The lame men are walking;
Sicknesses flee at His voice.
The dead live again,
And the poor hear the good news:
Jesus is King, so rejoice!
#3
(Last time)
We declare that the kingdom of God is here (Men)
We declare that the kingdom of God is here (Women)
We declare that the (Men)
Kingdom of God is here. (All)
