Blessed be the name of the Lord,
Blessed be the name of the Lord.
I will bless your holy name
For all my days;
Blessed be the name of the Lord.
#1
I am standing beneath your wings,
I am resting in your shelter,
Your great faithfulness has been my shield
And it makes me want to sing.
#2
I sing praises to your name, O Lord,
For you daily bear my burdens.
Your great faithfulness is my reward
And it makes me want to sing.
