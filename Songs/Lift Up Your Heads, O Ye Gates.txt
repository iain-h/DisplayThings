Lift up Your heads, O ye gates,
And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates,
And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors;
And the King of glory shall come in,
The King of glory shall come in,
The King of glory shall come in.

(women)
Who is the King of glory?
What is His name?
(Men)
The Lord strong and mighty,
The Lord, mighty in battle, strong to save.
#2
(Women)
Who shall ascend the hill,
The hill of the Lord?
(Men)
Even he that hath clean hands
And a pure heart with which to praise his God.
