Lead us to the promised land,
All that's purposed, all that's planned;
Give us eyes of faith again.
Take us on to higher ground
And the greater things to come -
Where the eagles soar,
And where we're finding more of you.
#1
Can we walk upon the water
If our eyes are fixed on you?
There's an air of faith within us
For a time of breaking through.
Can we fly a little higher,
Can we soar on eagle's wings?
Come and fan the flames of fire
That are flickering within.
#2
Can we walk into the promise
Of abundance in the land?
Take us on, beyond the river,
For the harvest you have planned:
Let us see your kingdom coming
In a measure we've not seen.
There has been a time of sowing,
Could this be a time to reap?
#3
And can we sing the songs of heaven
While we're standing on the earth:
Sing within the coming kingdom,
Sing and live and breathe and move?
#4
Can we fly a little higher,
Can we fly a little higher,
Can we fly a little higher,
Can we fly a little higher?
