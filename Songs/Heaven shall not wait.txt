#1
Heav'n shall not wait
For the poor to lose their patience,
The scorned to smile,
The despised to find a friend:
Jesus is Lord;
He has championed the unwanted;
In him injustice
Confronts its timely end.
#2
Heav'n shall not wait
For the rich to share their fortunes,
The proud to fall,
The elite to tend the least:
Jesus is Lord;
He has shown His master's privilege -
To kneel and wash
Servants' feet before they feast.
#3
Heav'n shall not wait
For the dawn of great ideas,
Thoughts of compassion
Divorced from cries of pain:
Jesus is Lord;
He has married word and action;
His cross and company
Make His purpose plain.
#4
Heav'n shall not wait
For our legalised obedience,
Defined by statute,
To strict conventions bound:
Jesus is Lord;
He has hallmarked true allegiance -
Goodness appears
Where His grace is sought and found.
#5
Heav'n shall not wait
For triumphant hallelujahs,
When earth has passed
And we reach another shore:
Jesus is Lord
In our present imperfection;
His pow'r and love
Are for now and then for evermore.
