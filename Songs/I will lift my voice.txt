Jesus, how I love you,
I will worship you alone.
Jesus, precious Jesus,
I will serve you, you alone.

I will lift my voice to the King of kings
As an offering to him.
I will lift my heart to the King of kings
As an offering to him.
#2
I will lift my hands to the Lord of lords
As an offering to him.
I will lift my life to the Lord of lords
As an offering to him.
