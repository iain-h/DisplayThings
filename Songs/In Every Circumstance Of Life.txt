In every circumstance of life
You are with me, glorious Father
And I have put my trust in you
That I may know the glorious hope to which I'm called
And by the power that works in me
You've raised me up and set me free
And now in every circumstance
I'll prove your love without a doubt
Your joy shall be my strength
Your joy shall be my strength
