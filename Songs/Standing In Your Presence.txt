Heaven and earth cry out Your name,
Nations rise up and see Your face;
And Your kingdom is established
As I live to know You more.
Now I will never be the same;
Spirit of God, my life You've changed,
And I'll forever sing Your praise.
I live to know You, Lord.
I live to know You, Lord.
#1
Standing in Your presence,
Lord, my heart and life are changed;
Just to love You and to live to
See Your beauty and Your grace.
#2
You've called me, I will follow;
Your will for me I'm sure.
Let Your heartbeat be my heart's cry,
Let me live to serve Your call.
