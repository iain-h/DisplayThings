O what a song we'll sing
And O what a tune we'll bear;
You deserve an anthem of the highest praise.
O what a joy will rise
And O what a sound we'll make;
You deserve an anthem of the highest praise.
#1
There is a louder shout to come,
There is a sweeter song to hear;
All the nations with one voice,
All the people with one fear.
Bowing down before your throne,
Every tribe and tongue will be;
All the nations with one voice,
All the people with one King.
And what a song we'll sing upon that day!
#2
Now we see a part of this,
One day we shall see in full;
All the nations with one voice,
All the people with one love.
No one else will share your praise,
Nothing else can take your place;
All the nations with one voice,
All the people with one Lord.
And what a song we'll sing upon that day!
#3
Even now upon the earth
There's a glimpse of all to come;
Many people with one voice,
Harmony of many tongues.
We will all confess your name,
You will be our only praise;
All the nations with one voice,
All the people with one God.
And what a song we'll sing upon that day!
