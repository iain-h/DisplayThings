Holy ground,
I'm standing on holy ground,
For the Lord my God
Is here with me.
#1
This is the place
Where dreams are found,
Where vision comes,
Called holy ground.
#2
Your fire burns
But never dies;
I realise
This is holy ground.
#3
The Great I AM,
Revealed to man;
Take off your shoes,
This is holy ground.
