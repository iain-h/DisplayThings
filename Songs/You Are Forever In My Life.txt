#C
I'll sing to You, Lord, a hymn of love
For Your faithfulness to me.
I'm carried in everlasting arms;
You'll never let me go,
Through it all.
#1
You are forever in my life,
You see me through the seasons;
Cover me with Your hand,
And lead me in Your righteousness.
And I look to You,
And I wait on You.
#2
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, hallelujah.
