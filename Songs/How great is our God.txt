How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great is our God
#1
The splendour of a King, clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice
He wraps himself in light, and darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice, and trembles at His voice
#2
Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands
Beginning and the end, beginning and the end
The Godhead Three in One, Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the Lamb, Lion and the Lamb

Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
My heart will sing,
"How great is our God"
