For I am lost without Your love,
All things are loss without Your love;
For I am lost without Your love,
All things are loss without Your love.
#1
Whatever I have gained,
Whatever I have done,
I leave it all behind to follow You.
The things that I attained,
The goals I may have gained,
A prize or any glory of my own.
#2
The wonder of Your love,
The wonder of Your grace;
To gain You and to know You as my Lord.
That I am found in You,
Your righteousness alone,
Is more than I could dream or ever ask.
