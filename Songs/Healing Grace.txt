Healing grace, healing grace,
Show me more of Your healing grace.
Fill my life anew as I worship You,
For Your healing grace to me.
#1
My eyes have been opened,
And now I can see
The love of the Father
Given to me.
#2
My Saviour, Deliverer,
The reason I sing,
To You I surrender,
For You are my King.
