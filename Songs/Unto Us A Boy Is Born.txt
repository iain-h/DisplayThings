Unto Us A Boy Is Born!
King of all creation,
Came He to a world forlorn,
The Lord of every nation,
The Lord of every nation.
#2
Cradled in a stall was He
With sleepy cows and asses;
But the very beasts could see
That He all men surpasses,
That He all men surpasses.

Herod then with fear was filled:
'A Prince,' he said, 'in Jewry!'
All the little boys he killed
At Bethlem in his fury,
At Bethlem in his fury.
#4
Now may Mary's Son who came
So long ago to love us,
Lead us all with hearts aflame
Unto the joys above us,
Unto the joys above us.
#5
Alpha and Omega He!
Let the organ thunder,
While the choir with peals of glee
Doth rend the air asunder,
Doth rend the air asunder!
