Every tongue in heaven and earth
Shall declare Your glory,
Every knee shall bow at Your throne
In worship;
You will be exalted, O God,
And Your kingdom shall not pass away,
O Ancient of Days.

Blessing and honour, glory and power
Be unto the Ancient of Days;
From every nation, all of creation
Bow before the Ancient of Days.

For none shall compare to Your matchless worth:
Sing unto the Ancient of Days.
