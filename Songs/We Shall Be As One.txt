#1
We shall be as one,
We shall be as one,
He the Father of us all,
We His chosen sons;
And by His command
Take each other's hand,
Live our lives in unity,
We shall be as one.
#2
We shall be as one,
We shall be as one;
And by this shall all men know
Of the work He has done.
Love will take us on
Through His precious Son;
Love of Him who first loved us,
We shall be as one.
