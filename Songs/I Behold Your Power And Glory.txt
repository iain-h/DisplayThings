#1
I Behold Your Power And Glory,
Bring an offering, come before You;
Worship You, Lord,
In the beauty of Your holiness.
(Repeat)
#2
Whenever I call, You're there,
Redeemer and Friend;
Cherished beyond all words,
This love never ends.
Morning by morning
Your mercy awakens my soul.
#3
I lift up my eyes to see
The wonders of heaven
Opening over me,
Your goodness abounds;
You've taken my breath away
With Your irresistible love.
