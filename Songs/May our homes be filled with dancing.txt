#C
From the mountain to the valley
Hear our praises rise to you
From the heavens to the nations
Hear our singing fill the air
#1
May our homes be filled with dancing
May our streets be filled with joy
May injustice bow to Jesus
As the people turn to pray
#2
May our light shine in the darkness
As we walk before the cross
May your glory fill the whole earth
As the water o'er the seas
