And all the angels sang for Him,
The bells of heaven rang for Him;
For a boy was born, King of all the world.
(Repeat)
#1
It Was On A Starry Night when the hills were bright,
Earth lay sleeping, sleeping calm and still;
Then in a cattle shed, in a manger bed
A boy was born, King of all the world.
#2
Soon the shepherds came that way, where the baby lay,
And were kneeling, kneeling by His side.
And their hearts believed again, for the peace of men;
For a boy was born, King of all the world.
