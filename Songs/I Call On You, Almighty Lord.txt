I Call On You, Almighty Lord;
I call on You, Almighty Lord.
I call on You, Almighty Lord;
I call on You, Almighty Lord.
#1
I come to You and stand before Your throne.
I lift my voice in worship here once more.
You turned the darkness in me into light.
You took my blinded soul and gave me sight.
As I sank down to the depths You heard my cry,
You lifted me and taught me how to fly.
You promised me You're always here to stay,
So as I stand before You, Lord, I want to say...
#2
The heavenly host are captured by the love
Of the One who laid His life down at the cross.
We lift the name of Jesus to the skies,
So all might see and know that there is life.
And where there's hatred let me bring Your love.
And where there's sorrow let me bring Your joy.
As I stand before You, will You lift Your face
And bring resurrection power to this place?
