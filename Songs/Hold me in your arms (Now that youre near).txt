#C
Hold me in you're arms
Never let me go
I want to spend eternity with You
And now that You're near 
Everything is different 
Everything's so different Lord
I know I'm not the same
My life You've changed 
I want to be with You
I want to be with You
#1
I stand before You Lord 
And give You all my praise
Your love is all I need
Jesus You're all I need
#2
My life belongs to You
You gave Your life for me
You're grace is all I need
Jesus you're all I need
#B
And I will sing for You always
 'cause in Your presence God
Is where I want to stay
