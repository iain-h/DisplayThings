And we sing glory, honour,
Power and strength to the Lord.
We sing glory, honour,
Power and strength to the Lord.
#1
In heavenly armour we'll enter the land,
The battle belongs to the Lord.
No weapon that's fashioned against us will stand,
The battle belongs to the Lord.
#2
When the Power of Darkness comes in like a flood,
The battle belongs to the Lord.
He's raised up a standard, the power of His blood,
The battle belongs to the Lord.
#3
When your enemy presses in hard, do not fear,
The battle belongs to the Lord.
Take courage, my friend, your redemption is near,
The battle belongs to the Lord.
