Amazing love, O what sacrifice,
The Son of God given for me.
My debt He pays, and my death He dies,
That I might live, that I might live.
#1
My Lord, what love is this?
That pays so dearly,
That I, the guilty one,
May go free!
#2
And so they watched Him die,
Despised, rejected;
But oh, the blood He shed
Flowed for me!
#3
And now, this love of Christ
Shall flow like rivers;
Come wash your guilt away,
Live again!
