Lord, by Your word we overcome.

More love, our hearts on fire.
More power, so faith stands strong.
More life, both real and pure.
More faith that holds the truth.
More, Lord, of You within Your church.
You, Lord, are King most glorious.

You, Lord, the One who knows us.
You, Lord, the love that calls us.
You, Lord, have power to keep us.
You, Lord, speak words of promise.
You, Lord, the life victorious.
You, Lord, are King most glorious.

You once were dead, but now You live:
