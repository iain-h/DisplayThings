I'm not alone for my Father is with me,
With me wherever I go.
Speaking words of faith, of courage and of love,
He's with me, He loves me, wherever I go.
#1
Waking in the morning,
Getting ready for school,
Walking down the road;
In class, at work, or at play,
He's with me, He loves me, wherever I go.
#2
And when I find myself in a mess,
I can trust in Him;
Call on His name and watch Him move,
He's with me, He loves me, wherever I go.
#3
All of my life, everywhere that I go,
I will walk with Him;
Praising Him and blessing His name,
He's with me, He loves me, wherever I go.
