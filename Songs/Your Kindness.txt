You are wonderful, beautiful,
Merciful, and all my life
And my heart belongs to You.
(Repeat)
#1
Your Kindness overwhelmed me,
The love that captured me.
You helped me to believe
That You delight in me.
You led me to the Father,
And introduced us there,
The Spirit poured out grace,
And filled me with Your praise.
#2
Your plans for me are greater
Than I had ever thought,
You're daily changing me,
Revealing more to me.
My love for You is growing,
And as I reach for You,
Your Spirit pours out grace
And fills me with Your praise.
