Send me, send me,
Lord of the harvest, send me!
Send me, send me,
Lord of the harvest, send me!
#1
We're here for the harvest,
Get ready to reap,
The call is for action,
It's not time to sleep.
We're here for the harvest,
The yield will be great;
The fields are now ripened,
So don't hesitate.
#2
There's need for more labourers,
For many, not few,
The challenge set before us
Is who? And we cry:
Lord of the harvest,
In this day of Your power,
Hear the anthem of voices: 'send me!'
#3
The Spirit is upon us,
To cause the blind to see;
The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord
To set the captive free.
The homeless and the needy
Can no longer be ignored,
And all oppressed will celebrate
The favour of the Lord.
There's need for more labourers
