And your grace
Clothes me in righteousness,
And your mercy
Covers me in love.
Your life adorns and beautifies,
I stand complete in you.
#1
God of grace, I turn my face to you,
I cannot hide;
My nakedness, my shame, my guilt,
Are all before your eyes.
Strivings and all anguished dreams
In rags lie at my feet;
And only grace provides the way
For me to stand complete.
