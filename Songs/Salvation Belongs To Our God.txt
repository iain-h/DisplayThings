Be to our God for ever and ever
Be to our God for ever and ever
Be to our God for ever and ever, amen
#1
Salvation belongs to our God
Who sits on the throne
And to the Lamb
Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks
Honour and power and strength
#2
And we the redeemed shall be strong
In purpose and unity
Declaring aloud
Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks
Honour and power and strength
