#1
The Power Of Your Love is changing me,
Changing me, changing me.
O Lord, change me by the power of Your love.
(Repeat)
#2
You've drawn me to Your side,
And what else can I do?
My heart is open wide,
My hands reach out to You.
I'm calling out for more;
I'm asking in Your name,
That by Your Spirit, Lord,
I will never be the same.
#3
I'm singing out my praise,
I'm pouring out my thanks,
For the power of Your love is changing me.
I'm lifting up my voice,
I'm dancing in the joy,
For the power of Your love is changing me.
