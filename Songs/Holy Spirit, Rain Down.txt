#1
O Comforter and Friend,
How we need Your touch again.
Holy Spirit, rain down, rain down.
Let Your power fall,
Let Your voice be heard,
Come and change our hearts,
As we stand on Your word.
Holy Spirit, rain down.
#2
No eye has seen, no ear has heard,
No mind can know what God has in store.
So open up heaven, open it wide
Over Your church, and over our lives.
(Repeat)
