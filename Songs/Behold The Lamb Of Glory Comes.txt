He rides in majesty, majesty He rides.
He rides in majesty, majesty He rides.
#1
Behold the Lamb of glory comes,
In majesty He rides.
Behold the Lion of Judah comes,
In majesty He rides.
#2
Behold the Sun of Righteousness,
On a white horse He rides.
His cavalry is following Him,
An army from on high.
#3
And when the Lord goes to battle,
Who can stand against His awesome might?
#4
Let God arise
And His enemies be scattered.
Whoa, whoa.
(Repeat)
#5
The watchmen on the tower
Are interceding for the land.
The saints proclaim God's victory,
He stretches forth His hand.
