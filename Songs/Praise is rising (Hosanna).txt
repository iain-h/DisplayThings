Hosanna,   Hosanna
You are the God who saves us
Worthy of all our praises
#1
Praise is rising, eyes are turning to you, we turn to you
Hope is stirring, hearts are yearning for you, we long for you
When we see you we find strength to face the day
In your presence all our fears are washed away, washed away
#2
Hear the sound of hearts returning to you, we turn to you
In your Kingdom, broken lives are made new, you make us new
When we see you we find strength to face the day
In your presence all our fears are washed away, washed away
