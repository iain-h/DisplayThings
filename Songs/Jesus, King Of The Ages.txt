Jesus, King Of The Ages,
Pleading our cause before the throne of God.
Jesus, the living Word of God,
Our Prophet, Priest and King,
Our Prophet, Priest and King.
#1
From the start You were there, Word of God,
Ancient promises You came to fulfil;
You came revealing the Father's heart,
His favour, His purpose, His will:
Sharing His good news with the poor,
Declaring God's kingdom is here.
#2
At the cross You poured out costly blood,
Perfect sacrifice, atoning for sin,
So we may enter the holy place
To meet You, our faithful High Priest;
As we come to the mercy seat
We find grace in our time of need.
#3
Jesus shall reign at the Father's hand
Till all of His enemies cease:
Hell and destruction, disease and death
Are under His glorious feet.
#4
We will reign with Christ, (echo)
We will reign with Christ, (echo)
We will reign with Christ (echo)
Forever.
