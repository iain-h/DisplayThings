That the Lamb who was slain
Might receive the reward,
Might receive the reward of His suffering.
#1
This is my belovèd Son
Who tasted death
That you, my child, might live.
See the blood He shed for you,
What suffering!
Say what more could He give?
Clothed in His perfection,
Bring praise, a fragrance sweet,
Garlanded with joy,
Come worship at His feet:
#2
Look, the world's great harvest fields
Are ready now,
And Christ commands us: 'Go!'
Countless souls are dying
So hopelessly,
His wondrous love unknown.
Lord, give us the nations
For the glory of the King.
Father, send more labourers,
The lost to gather in.
#3
Come the day when we will stand
There face to face,
What joy will fill His eyes.
For at last His Bride appears,
So beautiful,
Her glory fills the skies.
Drawn from every nation,
People, tribe and tongue;
All creation sings,
The wedding has begun.
#4
And the Lamb who was slain
Shall receive the reward,
Shall receive the reward of His suffering.
