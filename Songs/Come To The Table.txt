#1
Come to the table,
Drink from His cup;
Come to the table,
You can never get enough
Of His love for you,
Of His love for you.
Oh, such precious love.
Oh, such precious love.
#2
Turn your face to Him.
Let the feast begin.
With the angels sing:
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah to the Lord.
#3
We will come to the table,
Drink from Your cup;
Come to the table,
We can never get enough
Of the love You give,
Of the love You give.
Oh, such precious love.
Oh, such precious love.
