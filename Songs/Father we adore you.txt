You are the fountain of life,
You are the fountain of life,
And as we drink,
We are more than satisfied by you,
O Fountain of Life.

Father, we adore you,
We are your children gathered here;
To be with you is our delight,
A feast beyond compare.
#2
Father, in your presence
There is such freedom to enjoy.
We find in you a lasting peace
That nothing can destroy.
