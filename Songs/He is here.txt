And God is here with us,
Our Saviour, Jesus;
His mercy covers us.
Immanuel is here,
So tender, so near.
We welcome you, Immanuel,
Adore you more than words can tell,
We worship you.
Immanuel is here,
He is here.

He is here,
And we have come to worship him,
In His presence opening
The treasures of our hearts.
He is here,
The centre of our longings,
All our restless journeyings
Are ended in His peace.
#2
He is here,
And we have come to worship him,
In His presence opening
The treasures of our hearts.
He is here,
The One for whom the angels sing.
Heav'n and earth are touching,
This is a holy place.
