#C
Send forth Your light and Your truth,
Let them guide me,
Let them bring me to Your holy mountain,
To the place where You dwell.
(Repeat)
(Last time)
O Lord.
#1
Then I will come to the altar of God,
My joy and my delight;
Then I will offer the whole of my life,
A living sacrifice.
#2
Jesus, the Way and the Truth and the Life,
My Saviour and my Lord;
Knowing Your presence will be my delight,
Your glory my reward.
