Holy Spirit, come,
Holy Spirit, come.
Heal our hearts, our lives,
Cleanse our thoughts, our minds.
Holy Spirit, come,
O come to us.
#2
Holy Spirit, fall,
Holy Spirit, fall.
Drench us with your love,
Fill our lives with peace.
Holy Spirit, fall,
O fall on us.
#3
Holy Spirit, flow,
Holy Spirit, flow.
Lead us in your will,
Empowered to proclaim.
Holy Spirit, flow,
O flow through us.
