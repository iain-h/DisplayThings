Wake up, wake up, it's Christmas morning,
Christ's eternal day is dawning.
Angels sing in exultation,
Fill the streets with celebration.
Now to God on high be glory,
To the earth proclaim the story.
Ring the bells in jubilation,
Tell the news to every nation:
Christ has come! Christ has come!

Earth lies spellbound in darkness,
Sin's oppressive night;
Yet in Bethlehem hope is burning bright.
Mysteries are unfolding,
But the only sign is a manger bed
Where a baby cries.
#2
Crowding stairways of starlight,
Choirs of angels sing:
'Glory, glory to God in the highest heav'n.'
Peace is stilling the violence,
Hope is rising high, God is watching us now
Through a baby's eyes.
#3
Weakness shatters the pow'rful,
Meekness shames the proud,
Vain imaginings come tumbling down.
Ancient mercies remembered,
Hungry satisfied, lowly, humble hearts
Are lifted high.
