#1
We are His people drawn by grace,
Chosen by His glorious name,
Called to give Him all our praise,
Set apart to worship Him.
We must be humble now and pray,
And turn from all our careless ways,
And in our hearts wait for the hour
For Christ to come in awesome power.
#2
We are called to righteousness,
To be like God in holiness;
So let all slander now subside,
And flee from bitterness and rage.
And soon the night will fade away,
And in its place will come the day;
So we must clothe ourselves in light,
The armour that will help us fight.
Revere the name of the Lord,
And He will shine on you;
He will arise with healing
And set you free.
