Glorious, marvellous
Grace that rescued me;
Holy, worthy
Is the Lamb who died for me.
#1
Blessed Jesus, come to me,
Soothe my soul with songs of peace.
As I look to You alone,
Fill me with Your love.
#2
Mountains high and valleys low,
You will never let me go;
By Your fountain let me drink,
Fill my thirsty soul.
