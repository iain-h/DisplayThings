I will build my church, (men)
I will build My church, (Women)
And the gates of hell (Men)
And the gates of hell (Women)
Shall not prevail (Men)
Shall not prevail (Women)
Against it. (All)

So You powers in the heavens above, bow down!
And you powers on the earth below, bow down!
And acknowledge that Jesus,
Jesus, Jesus is Lord, is Lord.
