Arise and shine, your glory has come,
Arise and shine, your glory has come,
Arise and shine,
He is calling you by name;
Though your walls have fallen down,
He'll build you up again.
#1
Oh Fallen One, covered now in shame,
He is your hope, He is your life.
Though He should judge,
His anger turns away;
Rise from the dust, beautiful one.
#2
Don't be afraid,
For you're not left alone;
His heart of love is broken for you.
Your Father cares
For all your children now,
Arise in His name, beautiful one.
#3
Lift up your eyes,
Many come to see
The splendour your God has given to you.
Could each of your saints
Become a thousand saints?
Rise up and praise, beautiful one.
#4
So let Your salvation come,
For Your glory, Lord.
Set the captives free, we pray;
These souls are Your reward.
