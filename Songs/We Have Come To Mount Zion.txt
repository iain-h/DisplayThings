#1
We have come to mount zion,
To the city of the living God,
To Jesus our Redeemer,
And the sprinkling of His blood.
We're part of a kingdom that cannot be shaken,
We've got a foundation that cannot be moved;
So let us praise Him,
Hallelujah,
Let us praise the living God.
#2
Now we draw near to Him by faith,
Come through the veil,
For Jesus brings us by His new and living way into His holy place.
So let us come with boldness to the very throne of God the Father,
Enter in with confidence to meet Him face to face.
