#C
I want to be Holy,
I want to be righteous,
I want to live my life the way You want me to.
I want to be blameless,
Not walking in darkness,
I want to be a living sacrifice to You.
#1
I'm gonna run the race,
I'm gonna run to win,
Throw off everything that hinders me.
I'm gonna fix my eyes upon the King,
And leave my sin behind.
I want to be so much better,
I want to be more like You.
Keep taking me further and deeper,
I want to right the wrong,
I want to live this song,
Now I'm pressing on,
I'm gonna leave my sin behind.
#2
Singing, 'goodbye rage, goodbye hate,
Goodbye anger, goodbye malice,
Goodbye bitterness and slander,
Goodbye fear of man!'
(Repeat)
