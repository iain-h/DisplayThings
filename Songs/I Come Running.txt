Only You, Lord, will I worship,
Only You will I serve.
And my hope lies in You, Lord,
Only You can make me whole.
And I will say 'I love You.'
Yes, I will sing to You, to You.
#1
I Come Running to You, Father,
Trying to find a secret place with You.
My soul crying out, just to hear Your voice,
Oh, I must have You.
#2
I come running to You, Jesus,
I'm so hungry for Your truth.
I've found many treasures
Hidden in Your word,
But I must have You.
#3
I come longing for You, Spirit,
So dry I need to know Your touch.
I know living waters deep within me,
But I must have more of You.
