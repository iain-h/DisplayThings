The love of God was found in the nails;
The love of God was seen in the scars.
The light and the life was darkened by death,
My hope and salvation carried to life,
Unfailing love.
#1
The love of God, heaven's hope;
This perfect peace, this rest for my soul.
This love divine, portrayed in pain,
The cross stands alone,
Unfailing love.
#2
This love of God, creation's cry;
Perfection portrayed, broken for me.
The Author of life has suffered our pain.
The cross stands alone,
Unfailing love.
#3
The love of God, written in blood;
This empty grave, the stone rolled away!
The mercy of God has triumphed in Christ.
The cross stands alone,
Unfailing love.
