So I will celebrate
And drink your cup of joy,
I will give thanks each day and sing.
My joy is found in you
And you are all my joy.
Oh, I was made for this.
#1
Oh, I was made for this,
To know your tender kiss,
To know a love divine,
To know this love is mine.
And I was made to laugh,
And I was made to sing,
Given the gift of life,
You gave me everything.
(Repeat)
#2
My feet were made to dance,
My spirit made to soar;
My life is not by chance,
You give me more and more.
For I was made for you,
And I have made my choice,
And all that stole my joy,
I left it at the cross.
#3
When I was far away,
You ran to welcome me;
I felt your warm embrace,
I saw your smiling face.
And when you rescued me,
I saw my destiny:
To worship you, my Lord,
To be a friend of God.
#4
I was made to love you, Jesus,
I was made for this.
I was made to love you, Jesus,
I was made for this.
