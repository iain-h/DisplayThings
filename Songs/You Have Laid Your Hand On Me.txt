How can I live, how can I live,
How can I live without Your love?
How can I live, how can I live,
How can I live without Your love?
#1
You Have Laid Your Hand On Me,
I am changed forever;
There is nothing that compares
With knowing You.
You have spoken words of love
That lift my Spirit higher;
Jesus Christ, my dearest friend,
I'm never letting go.
#2
Help me never to forget
What I used to be,
Though the past that I regret
Is over now.
I will never be ashamed
Of calling You my friend.
I no longer hide from You,
I'm running to Your side.
#3
All the riches I possess
Are meaningless to me;
Your love is the greatest gift,
The very air I breathe.
