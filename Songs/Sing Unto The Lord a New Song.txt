Sing unto the Lord a new song,
Sing unto the Lord, all the earth.
Sing to the Lord, bless His name,
He is greatly to be praised,
Sing unto the Lord a new song.
#1
Tell among the nations the Lord reigns,
The world shall never be moved.
Let the heavens be glad
And the earth rejoice,
Sing unto the Lord a new song.
#2
Then shall all the trees sing for joy
Before the Lord, for He comes.
He will judge the world
With His righteousness,
Sing unto the Lord a new song.
