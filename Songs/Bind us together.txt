Bind us together, Lord,
Bind us together
With cords that cannot be broken.
Bind us together, Lord,
Bind us together,
Bind us together with love.
#1
There is only one God.
There is only one King.
There is only one Body.
That is why we sing:
#2
Made for the glory of God,
Purchased by His precious Son.
Born with the right to be clean,
For Jesus the victory has won.
#3
You are the family of God.
You are the promise divine.
You are God's chosen desire.
You are the glorious new wine.
