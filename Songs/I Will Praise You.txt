The Lord will fulfil His purpose for me.
The Lord will fulfil His purpose for me.
Do not forsake the work of Your hands,
Revive me, Lord.

I will praise You,
O Lord, with all of my heart.
I will praise You,
O Lord, with all of my heart.
Before the gods I will sing Your praise.
Before the gods I will praise Your name.

You have exalted above all things
Your name and Your word.
You have exalted above all things
Your name and Your word.
I called to You, and You answered me.
When I called to You, You made me strong.
#3
For Your love, O Lord, endures forever,
And Your faithfulness is to the clouds.
Do not forsake the work of Your hands,
Revive me, Lord.
