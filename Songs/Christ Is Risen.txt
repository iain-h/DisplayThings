Christ is risen!
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
Christ is risen!
Risen indeed, hallelujah!
#1
Love's work is done,
The battle is won:
Where now, O death, is your sting?
He rose again
To rule and to reign,
Jesus our conquering King.
#2
Lord over sin,
Lord over death,
At His feet Satan must fall!
Every knee bow,
All will confess
Jesus is Lord over all!
#3
Tell it abroad
'Jesus is Lord!'
Shout it and let your praise ring!
Gladly we raise
Our songs of praise,
Worship is our offering.
