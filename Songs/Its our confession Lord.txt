#C
Let your mercies fall from heaven,
Sweet mercies flow from heaven,
New mercies for today,
O shower them down, Lord, as we pray.
(Repeat)
#1
It's our confession, Lord,
That we are weak,
So very weak,
But you are strong.
And though we've nothing, Lord,
To lay at your feet,
We come to your feet
And say, 'Help us along'.
#2
A broken heart and a contrite spirit
You have yet to deny.
Your heart of mercy beats
With love's strong current;
Let the river flow by your Spirit now,
Lord, we cry:
#A
