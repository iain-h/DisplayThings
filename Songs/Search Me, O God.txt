For You are an all consuming fire!
For You are an all consuming fire!
#1
Search me, O God,
And know my heart;
Know all my thoughts and my ways.
Cleanse me, O God,
Give me a pure heart,
That I may see Your face.
#2
Teach me, O God,
Show me Your ways,
And I will walk in Your truth.
Keep me, O God,
Keep me from falling,
That I may stand before You.
#3
Fill me, O God,
And send me out,
And I will make You known.
Give me Your heart
And Your compassion,
And let Your mercy flow.
