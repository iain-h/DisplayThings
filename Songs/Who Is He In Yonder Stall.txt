'tis the Lord!
O wondrous story!
'Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
At His feet we humbly fall.
Crown Him! Crown Him, Lord of all!
#1
Who is He in yonder stall,
At whose feet the shepherds fall?
#2
Who is He to whom they bring
All the sick and sorrowing?
#3
Who is He on yonder tree
Dies in pain and agony?
#4
Who is He who from the grave
Comes to rescue, help, and save?
#5
Who is He who from His throne
Sends the Spirit to His own?
#6
Who is He who comes again,
Judge of angels and of men?
