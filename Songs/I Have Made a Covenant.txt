I will celebrate Your love forever, yahweh,
Age on age my words proclaim Your love.
For I claim that love is built to last forever,
Founded firm Your faithfulness.
#1
I have made a covenant with my chosen,
Given My servant My word.
I have made Your name to last forever,
Built to outlast all time.
#2
Yahweh, that assembly of those who love You
Applaud Your marvellous word.
Who in the skies can compare with Yahweh?
Who can rival Him?
#3
Happy the people who learn to acclaim You,
They rejoice in Your light.
You are our glory and You are our courage,
Our hope belongs to You.
#4
I have revealed My chosen servant
And He can rely on Me,
Given Him My love to last forever,
He shall rise in My name.
#5
He will call to Me, 'My Father, My God!'
For I make Him My firstborn Son.
I cannot take back My given promise,
I've called Him to shine like the sun.
