#1
My heart will sing to you because of your great love,
A love so rich, so pure, a love beyond compare;
The wilderness, the barren place,
Become a blessing in the warmth of your embrace.
#2
When earthly wisdom dims the light of knowing you,
Or if my search for understanding clouds your way,
To you I fly, my hiding-place,
Where revelation is beholding face to face.
#3
May my heart sing your praise for ever,
May my voice lift your name, my God;
May my soul know no other treasure
Than your love, than your love.
