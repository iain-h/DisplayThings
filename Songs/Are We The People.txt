Are we the people
Who will see God's kingdom come,
When He is known in every nation?
One thing is certain,
We are closer than before;
Keep moving on, last generation.
#1
These are the days for harvest,
To gather in the lost;
Let those who live in darkness
Hear the message of the cross.
#2
We'll go where God is sending,
We'll do what He commands;
These years that He has waited
Could be coming to an end.
