Consuming fire, fan into flame
A passion for Your name
Spirit of God, fall in this place
Lord, have Your way
Lord, have Your way with us
#1
There Must Be More than this
O Breath of God, come breathe within
There must be more than this
Spirit of God, we wait for You
Fill us anew, we pray
Fill us anew, we pray
#2
Come like a rushing wind
Clothe us with power from on high
Now set the captives free
Leave us abandoned to Your praise
Lord, let Your glory fall
Lord, let Your glory fall
#3
Stir it up in our hearts Lord
Stir it up in our hearts Lord
Stir it up in our hearts
A passion for your name
