Hail, thou ever-blessšd morn!
Hail, redemption's happy dawn!
Sing through all Jerusalem:
Christ is born in Bethlehem!
#1
See, amid the winter's snow,
Born for us on earth below,
See, the Lamb of God appears,
Promised from eternal years.
#2
Lo, within a manger lies
He who built the starry skies,
He who throned in height sublime
Sits amid the cherubim.
#3
Say, ye holy shepherds, say,
What your joyful news today;
Wherefore have ye left your sheep
On the lonely mountain steep?
#4
'As we watched at dead of night,
Lo, we saw a wondrous light:
Angels singing, "Peace on earth"
Told us of the Saviour's birth.'
#5
Sacred Infant, all divine,
What a tender love was Thine,
Thus to come from highest bliss
Down to such a world as this!
#6
Teach, O teach us, holy Child,
By Thy face so meek and mild,
Teach us to resemble Thee
In Thy sweet humility.
