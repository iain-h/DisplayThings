This is the message of the cross,
That we can be free,
To live in the victory
And turn from our sin.
My precious Lord Jesus,
With sinners you died,
For there you revealed your love
And you laid down your life.
#2
This is the message of the cross,
That we can be free,
To lay all our burdens here,
At the foot of the tree.
The cross was the shame of the world,
But the glory of God,
For Jesus you conquered sin
And you gave us new life.
#3
You set me free
When I came to the cross,
Poured out your blood
For I was broken and lost.
There I was healed
And you covered my sin.
It's there you saved me.
This is the message of the cross.
#4
This is the message of the cross,
That we can be free,
To hunger for heaven,
To hunger for thee.
The cross is such foolishness
To the perishing,
But to us who are being saved,
It is the power of God.
#5
You set us free
When we come to the cross,
You pour out your blood
For we are broken and lost.
Here we are healed
And you cover our sin.
It's here you save us.
You set me free
When I come to the cross,
Pour out your blood
For I am broken and lost.
Here I am healed
And you cover my sin.
It's here you save me.
This is the message of the cross.
#6
Let us rejoice at the foot of the cross;
We can be free, glory to God.
Let us rejoice at the foot of the cross;
We can be free, Glory to God.
Thank you, Lord, thank you, Lord,
You've set us free, glory to God.
Thank you, Lord, thank you, Lord,
You've set us free, glory to God.
