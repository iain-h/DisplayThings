Fill us up and send us out
In the power of your name.
Fill us up and send us out
In the power of your name.
#1
Have you not said
As we pass through water,
You will be with us?
And you have said
As we walk through fire,
We will not be burned.
We are not afraid,
For you are with us;
We will testify
To the honour of your name.
We are witnesses,
You have shown us,
You are the one who can save.
#2
Bring them from the west,
Sons and daughters,
Call them for your praise.
Gather from the east
All your children,
Coming home again.
Bring them from afar,
All the nations,
From the north and south,
Drawing all the peoples in.
Corners of the earth,
Come to see
There's only one Saviour and King.
