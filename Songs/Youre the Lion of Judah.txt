And the angels will cry:
'Hail the Lamb who was slain
For the world û rule in pow'r.'
And the earth will reply:
'You shall reign
As the King of all kings
And the Lord of all lords.'
#1
You're the Lion of Judah,
The Lamb that was slain,
You ascended to heaven
And evermore will reign;
At the end of the age
When the earth you reclaim,
You will gather the nations before you.
And the eyes of all men
Will be fixed on the Lamb
Who was crucified,
For with wisdom and mercy
And justice he reigns
At the Father's side.
#2
There's a shield in our hand
And a sword at our side,
There's a fire in our spirit
That cannot be denied;
As the Father has told us:
For these you have died,
For the nations that gather before you.
And the ears of all men
Need to hear of the Lamb
Who was crucified,
Who descended to hell
Yet was raised up to reign
At the Father's side.
