#1
Angels bow before You,
Kings fall at Your command.
And yet Your love comes down to earth
To fallen man.
How can I know Your workings,
Eternal mystery?
I must bow down and give my life,
Must follow You.
#2
And I love You, Lord,
Everything belongs to You,
Is known by You,
And made for Your eternal glory.
You, my Lord, receive the praise
Of my thankful heart.
