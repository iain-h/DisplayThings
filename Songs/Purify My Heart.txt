Refiner's fire
My heart's one desire
Is to be holy
Set apart for You, Lord
I choose to be holy
Set apart for You, my Master
Ready to do Your will
#1
Purify my heart
Let me be as gold
And precious silver
Purify my heart
Let me be as gold
Pure gold
#2
Purify my heart 
Cleanse me from within
And make me holy
Purify my heart 
Cleanse me from my sin
Deep within
