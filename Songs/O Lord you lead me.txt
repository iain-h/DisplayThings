Have faith in God,
Let your hope rest
On the faith he has placed in your heart.
Never give up,
Never let go
Of the faith he has placed in your heart.
#1
O Lord, you lead me
By the still waters,
Quietly restoring my soul.
You speak words of wisdom,
The promise of glory,
The pow'r of the presence of God.
#2
O Lord, you guide me
Through all the darkness,
Turning my night into day;
You'll never leave me,
Never forsake me
The pow'r of the presence of God.
