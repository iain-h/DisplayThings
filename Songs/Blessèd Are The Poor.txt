Rejoice and be glad,
For great your reward in heaven.
(Repeat)
#1
Blessèd are the poor in spirit,
For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessèd are the mourning hearts,
Comfort to them will be given.
Blessèd are the humble and meek,
They will inherit the earth.
Blessèd are those who hunger and thirst
For righteousness,
For they will be filled.
#2
Blessèd are the merciful,
For mercy to them will be shown.
Blessèd are the pure in heart,
For they will see their God.
Blessèd are the makers of peace,
They will be called sons of God.
Blessèd are those who suffer for Christ
And righteousness,
Theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
#B
Give glory to God,
For He's our reward in heaven.
