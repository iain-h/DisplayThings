And I'll stand in awe of You,
Yes, I'll stand in awe of You.
And I'll let my words be few:
Jesus, I am so in love with You.
#1
You Are God In Heaven,
And here am I on earth;
So I'll let my words be few:
Jesus, I am so in love with You.
#2
The simplest of all love songs
I want to bring to You;
So I'll let my words be few:
Jesus, I am so in love with You.
