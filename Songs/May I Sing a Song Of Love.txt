#C
Draw me near into Your heart.
All I have is broken love,
And a thirst that cries for more.
Draw me near to You.
#1
May I sing a song of love
To the One who saved my soul?
May I bow my head today
In the presence of the King?
#2
You have called and I will come,
Lift my hands up to Your throne;
Worship You on holy ground -
That's what I long to do.
