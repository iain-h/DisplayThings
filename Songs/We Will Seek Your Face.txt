Lifting up the name of the Lord
In power and in unity,
We will see the nations turn,
Touching heaven, changing earth,
Touching heaven, changing earth.
#1
We Will Seek Your Face, Almighty God,
Turn and pray for You to heal our land.
Father, let revival start in us,
Then every heart will know Your kingdom come.
#2
Never looking back, we'll run the race;
Giving You our lives, we'll gain the prize.
We will take the harvest given us,
Though we sow in tears, we'll reap in joy.
#3
Send revival, send revival,
Send revival to us.
(Repeat)
