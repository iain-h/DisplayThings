Every place, every place
Where our feet shall tread,
Every tribe, every race
God has given us.
#1
As we see the world in tatters,
As we watch their dreams break down,
We can hear their quiet anguish:
'Come and help us!'
Brought to life by God's own Spirit,
Joined together in His Son,
Now the church with strength arises
Like an army.
#2
In the midst of boastful darkness
Shines a Light that cannot fail,
And the blind behold His glory,
Jesus! Jesus!
Not content with restoration
Of the remnant in the land,
He has filled us with His power
For the nations.
