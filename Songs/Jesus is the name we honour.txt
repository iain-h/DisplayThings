We will lift him high,
We will give him honour and praise.
We will glorify,

Jesus is the name we honour;
Jesus is the name we praise.
Majestic Name above all other names,
The highest heav'n and earth proclaim
That Jesus is our God.
#2
Jesus is the name we worship;
Jesus is the name we trust.
He is the King above all other kings,
Let all creation stand and sing
That Jesus is our God.
#3
Jesus is the Father's splendour;
Jesus is the Father's joy.
He will return to reign in majesty,
And every eye at last will see
That Jesus is our God.
