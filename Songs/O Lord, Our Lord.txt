O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth.
O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth.
#1
You have set Your glory above the heavens,
From children's lips You have ordained praise;
You have set the moon and the stars in place,
And You still remember me.
#2
What is man that You are mindful of him;
The son of man that You take care of him?
You have put everything beneath his feet,
And made him ruler of Your works.
