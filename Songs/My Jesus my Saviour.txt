Shout to the Lord,
All the earth, let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the King.
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
At the sound of your name.
I sing for joy
At the work of your hands.
For ever I'll love you, for ever I'll stand.
Nothing compares to the promise
I have in you.

My Jesus, my Saviour,
Lord, there is none like you.
All of my days
I want to praise
The wonders of your mighty love.
My comfort, my shelter,
Tower of refuge and strength,
Let every breath,
All that I am,
Never cease to worship you.
