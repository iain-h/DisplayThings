Father me, forever you'll Father me,
And in Your embrace I'll be forever secure.
I love the way You father me.
I love the way You father me.

O Father of the fatherless,
In whom all families are blessed,
I love the way You father me.
You gave me life, forgave the past,
Now in Your arms I'm safe at last,
I love the way You father me.
#2
When bruised and broken I draw near
You hold me close and dry my tears,
I love the way You father me.
At last my fearful heart is still,
Surrendered to Your perfect will,
I love the way You father me.
#3
If in my foolishness I stray,
Returning empty and ashamed,
I love the way You father me.
Exchanging for my wretchedness
Your radiant robes of righteousness,
I love the way You father me.
#4
And when I look into Your eyes
From deep within my spirit cries,
I love the way You father me.
Before such love I stand amazed
And ever will through endless days,
I love the way You father me.
