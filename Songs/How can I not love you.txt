#1
How can I not love you
When I see all that you've given me?
How can I not love you,
Jesus, my Lord?
#2
I love you, first and last,
In your love I've come to rest.
I will dwell before your throne.
You are my eternal home.
#3
How can I not serve you,
When I see all that you've done for me?
How can I not serve you,
Jesus, my Lord.
#4
I draw near by your grace,
I desire to seek your face.
In your presence there is light,
You are my eternal life.
