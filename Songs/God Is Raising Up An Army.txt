God is raising up an army
Made of those who are still young.
God is lifting up their voices,
Through the weak He'll shame the strong.
It's been prophesied they will prophesy,
God's salvation they will show;
For the promise is to the children,
To our daughters and our sons.

Children of the cross,
A shining example,
Children of the cross
Are singing His praise.
Children of the cross
Are silencing the enemy,
Children of the cross
Are saying the Lord saves.
