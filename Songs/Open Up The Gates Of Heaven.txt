('Cause) all I want is to know You more.
All I want is to meet with You in this place.
All I want is to be with You,
To feel Your embrace.
#1
Open Up The Gates Of Heaven.
Open up the gates of heaven.
Open up the gates of heaven.
Open up the gates of heaven,
#2
And let Your river flow,
And let new mercies fall like rain;
Oh, let me know Your presence.
You are all I need;
Let all earthly passion fade away,
