All over the world people just like us
Are calling your name,
Living in your love;
All over the world people just like us
Are calling on Jesus.
All over the world people just like us
Are calling your name,
Living in your love;
All over the world people just like us
Are following Jesus.
(Last time)
We're worshipping Jesus,
We're following Jesus,
We're worshipping Jesus,
We're calling on Jesus.
#1
Every nation, pow'r and tongue
Will bow down to your name;
Every eye will see, every ear will hear
Your name proclaimed.
This is gonna be our cry
Until you come again.
Jesus is the only name
By which man can be saved.
#2
Makes you wanna dance,
Makes you wanna sing,
Makes you wanna shout all about it,
Shout all about it, shout it
That Jesus is King.
