If there's one thing we are called to do,
It's to love You, to adore You.
We will bring our all and worship You,
Bow before You, as we love You.
#1
You Call Us First to love Your name,
To worship You.
To please Your heart our one desire,
O Lord.
#2
Your honour, Lord, Your name's renown
We long to see.
So let the glory of Your name
Be praised.
#3
I will celebrate this love,
Jesus, You are everything to me.
For what more, Lord, can I do?
I will give this heart, this life to You.
