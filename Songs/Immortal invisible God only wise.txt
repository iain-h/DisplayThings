Immortal, invisible,
God only wise,
In light inaccessible
Hid from our eyes,
Most blessed, most glorious,
The Ancient of Days,
Almighty, victorious,
Thy great name we praise.
#2
Unresting, unhasting,
And silent as light,
Nor wanting, nor wasting,
Thou rulest in might;
Thy justice like mountains
High soaring above
Thy clouds which are fountains
Of goodness and love.
#3
To all life thou givest,
To both great and small;
In all life thou livest,
The true life of all;
We blossom and flourish
As leaves on the tree,
And wither and perish;
But naught changeth thee.
#4
Great Father of glory,
Pure Father of light,
Thine angels adore thee,
All veiling their sight;
All laud we would render,
O help us to see,
'tis only the splendour
Of light hideth thee.
#5
Immortal, invisible,
God only wise,
In light inaccessible
Hid from our eyes,
Most blessed, most glorious,
The Ancient of Days,
Almighty, victorious,
Thy great name we praise.
