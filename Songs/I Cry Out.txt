#1
I cry out
For your hand of mercy to heal me.
I am weak,
I need Your love to free me.
O Lord, my Rock,
My strength in weakness,
Come rescue me, O Lord.
#2
You are my hope,
Your promise never fails me.
And my desire
Is to follow You forever.
For You are good,
For You are good,
For You are good to me.
For You are good,
For You are good,
For You are good to me.
