O what else can I do
But kneel and worship you,
And come just as I am,
My whole life an offering.
#1
What kind of greatness can this be,
That chose to be made small?
Exchanging untold majesty
For a world so pitiful.
That God should come as one of us,
I'll never understand.
The more I hear the story told,
The more amazed I am.
#2
The One in whom we live and move
In swaddling clothes lies bound.
The voice that cried, 'Let there be light',
Asleep without a sound.
The One who strode among the stars,
And called each one by name,
Lies helpless in a mother's arms
And must learn to walk again.
#3
What greater love could he have shown
To shamed humanity,
Yet human pride hates to believe
In such deep humility.
But nations now may see His grace
And know that he is near,
When His meek heart, His words, His works
Are incarnate in us.
