All over the world we're singing,
All over the world there's praise
To the King of our salvation,
And the Author of our faith.
All over the world we're dancing,
All over the world there's joy,
We've called upon Your name
And we are saved.
#1
There's A Calling To The Nations
To make ready in Your name,
To take up the yoke of Jesus
And proclaim the coming day.
There's a pouring of Your Spirit
As our old men dream Your dreams;
Prophesy through sons and daughters,
Come envision us again.
#2
You're the Word and the Word is Truth,
You're the Promise that was born in You,
And a wave of expectation fills my soul!
#3
Can it be this generation
That will hear revival's song,
As Your Spirit of creation
Comes awakening the lost?
Let the four winds blow Your justice,
Come and harvest of the earth;
Turn our mourning into dancing
As we herald Your return.
