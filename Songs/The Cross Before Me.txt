Not to us,
But to Your name be the glory.
(Repeat)
#1
The Cross Before Me, the world behind;
No turning back, raise the banner high:
It's not for me, it's all for You.
Let the heavens shake and split the sky,
Let the people clap their hands and cry:
It's not for us, it's all for You.
#2
Our hearts unfold before Your throne,
The only place for those who know:
It's not for us, it's all for You.
Send Your holy fire on this offering,
Let our worship burn for the world to see:
It's not for us, it's all for You.
#3
The earth is shaking, the mountains shouting:
It's all for You.
The waves are crashing, the sun is raging:
It's all for You.
#4
The universe spinning and singing:
It's all for You.
Your children dancing, dancing, dancing:
It's all for You, it's all for You.
My all for You, my all for You.
