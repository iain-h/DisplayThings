You said:
'Ask, and I'll give the nations to you.'
O Lord, that's the cry of my heart.
Distant shores and the islands will see
Your light as it rises on us.

You Said:
'Ask and you will receive
Whatever you need.'
You said:
'Pray, and I'll hear from heaven,
And I'll heal your land.'
#2
You said
Your glory will fill the earth,
Like water the sea.
You said:
'Lift up your eyes,
The harvest is here,
The kingdom is here.'

O Lord, I ask for the nations.
