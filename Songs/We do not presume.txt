#1
We do not presume
To come to your table
Trusting in our own righteousness.
For we are not worthy so much
As to gather the crumbs
From under your table.
But trusting, O Lord,
In your great and manifold mercies.
For you are the same Lord
Whose nature's always to have mercy.
#2
So cleanse us and feed us
With the body and blood of your Son.
That we may live in him,
That he may live in us
For ever and ever. Amen.
