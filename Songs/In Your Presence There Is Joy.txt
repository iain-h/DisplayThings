God of glory, we give You praise,
Lift You up in this holy place;
Our hearts are ready, our lives made new,
It's all we long to do.
God of glory, we give You praise,
We lift You up in this holy place;
Our hearts are ready, our lives made new,
God of glory, we worship You.

In Your Presence There Is Joy,
In Your presence there is freedom,
But the greatest joy of all
Is to know we've made You smile.
In Your presence there is life,
In Your presence there is healing,
But the greatest joy of all
Is to know we've reached Your heart.
