Let the bride say 'come',
Let the Bride say 'come',
Let the Bride of the Lamb
Say 'come, Lord Jesus!'
Let the Bride say 'come',
Let the Bride say 'come',
Let the Bride of the Lamb
Say 'come, Lord Jesus, come!'
#1
This is the mystery,
That Christ has chosen you and me
To be the revelation of His glory;
A chosen, royal, holy people,
Set apart and loved,
A Bride preparing for her King.
#2
She's crowned in splendour
And a royal diadem,
The King is enthralled by her beauty.
Adorned in righteousness,
Arrayed in glorious light,
The Bride in waiting for her King.
#3
Now hear the Bridegroom call,
'Beloved, come aside;
The time of betrothal is at hand.
Lift up your eyes and see
The dawning of the day,
When as King, I'll return to claim My Bride.'
