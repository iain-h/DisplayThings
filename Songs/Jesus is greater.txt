#1
Jesus is greater than the greatest heroes,
Jesus is closer than the closest friends.
He came from heaven and he died to save us,
To show us love that never ends.
(Repeat)
#2
Son of God, and the Lord of glory,
He's the light, follow in His way.
He's the truth that we can believe in,
And he's the life, he's living today.
(Repeat)
