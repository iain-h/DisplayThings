What did I do to deserve Your favour?
What did I do to deserve Your grace?
Called by my name into Your presence,
Undeserved, holy God.
#1
Lord, I Come, longing to know You,
Lord, I come, drawn by Your love;
Lord, I come, longing to see Your face,
For You called me to come
Into the holiest place.
#2
Lord, I come, because of Jesus,
Lord, I come, because He came;
Lord, I bow, as You reveal Your face,
You have called me to come
Into the holiest place.
