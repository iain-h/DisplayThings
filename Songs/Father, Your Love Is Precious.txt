Father, Your love is precious beyond all loves,
Father, Your love overwhelms me.
Father, Your love is precious beyond all loves,
Father, Your love overwhelms me.

So I lift up my hands, an expression of my love,
And I give You my heart in joyful obedience.
Father, Your love is precious beyond all loves,
Father, Your love overwhelms me.
