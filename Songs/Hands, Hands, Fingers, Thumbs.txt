Hands, hands, fingers, thumbs,
We can lift to praise You.
Hands, hands, fingers, thumbs,
We can lift to praise.
Hands, hands, fingers, thumbs,
We can lift to praise You.
Jump front, jump back, yeah!
We were made to praise.
#1
We've got some hands that we can raise.
We've got a voice to shout Your praise, Jesus!
Got some feet a-made to dance;
Let's use them now we've got the chance.

#2
We were made to praise You,
We were made to praise.
We were made to praise You,
We were made to praise.
