At this time of giving,
Gladly now we bring
Gifts of goodness and mercy
From a heavenly King.
#1
Earth could not contain the treasures
Heaven holds for you,
Perfect joy and lasting pleasures,
Love so strong and true.
#2
May His tender love surround you
At this Christmastime;
May you see His smiling face
That in the darkness shines.
#3
But the many gifts He gives
Are all poured out from one;
Come receive the greatest gift,
The gift of God's own Son.
