Forever more we'll sing the story
Of love come down.
Forever more the King of glory
We will crown.
#1
Who can ever say they understand
All the wonders of His master plan?
Christ came down and gave Himself toman
Forever more.
#2
He was Lord before all time began,
Yet made Himself the sacrificial lamb,
Perfect love now reconciled to man
Forever more.
#3
He is coming back to earth again,
Every knee shall bow before His name,
'Christ is Lord', let thankful hearts proclaim
Forever more.
