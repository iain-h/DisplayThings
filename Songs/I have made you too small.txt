Be magnified, O Lord,
You are highly exalted;
And there is nothing you can't do,
O Lord, my eyes are on you.
Be magnified,
O Lord, be magnified.
#1
I have made you too small in my eyes,
O Lord, forgive me;
And I have believed in a lie
That you were unable to help me,
But now, O Lord, I see my wrong:
Heal my heart and show yourself strong,
And in my eyes and with my song,
O Lord, be magnified,
O Lord, be magnified.
#2
I have leaned on the wisdom of men,
O Lord, forgive me;
And I have responded to them
Instead of your light and your mercy.
But now, O Lord, I see my wrong:
Heal my heart and show yourself strong,
And in my eyes and with my song,
O Lord, be magnified,
O Lord, be magnified.
