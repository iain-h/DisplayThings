Lord send the rain,
Let Your Spirit come and glorify Jesus.
Lord send the rain,
Let Your Spirit come like a pent up flood,
Driven by the breath of God.
#1
Days of heaven here on the earth;
Touched by power, touched by love.
By Your word and by Your Spirit
You send a blessing here on us.
#2
We bring our worship, we see Your face;
We stand in wonder of Your grace.
Your kingdom presence, Your majesty;
Jesus, You're here now, hear our plea.
