O Saviour and Friend,
Redeemer of many,
You poured out Your blood to me,
And gave up Your life for me.
(Oh, thank You.)
#1
Have We Forgotten the price that's been paid?
Have we remembered the wage of our ways?
Can we dismiss what He's done on the cross
As foolishness?
Oh, thank You, oh, thank You.
#2
It was my life He paid with His pain,
Suffered at the hands of those He had made.
Can we consider what He once went through
To be with us?
Oh, thank You, oh, thank You.
#3
Oh, how can I repay such a love?
Oh, how can I repay such a love?
How can I repay such a love?
Oh, thank You.
