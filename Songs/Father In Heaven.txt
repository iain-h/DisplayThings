Father in heaven, Holy is Your name.
Your kingdom come, Your will be done,
Let it be the same.
(Repeat)
On earth as it is in heaven,
On earth as it is in heaven.
(Repeat)
#2
Give us today all our daily bread,
As we forgive our debtors,
So You forgive our debts.
(Repeat)
And lead us not into temptation;
Deliver us from evil.
(Repeat)
#3
For Yours is the kingdom,
The power and the glory,
Forever and ever and ever, amen.
