#1
May our worship
Be as fragrance,
May our worship
Be as incense poured forth,
May our worship
Be acceptable as a living sacrifice,
As a living sacrifice.
#2
We are willing
To pay the price,
We are willing
To lay down our lives
As an offering of obedience,
As a living sacrifice,
As a living sacrifice.
