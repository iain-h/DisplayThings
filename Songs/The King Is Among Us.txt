The King is among us,
His Spirit is here,
Let's draw near and worship,
Let songs fill the air.
#1
He looks down upon us,
Delight in His face,
Enjoying His children's love,
Enthralled by our praise.
#2
For each child is special,
Accepted and loved,
A love gift from Jesus
To His Father above.
#3
And now He is giving
His gifts to us all,
For no one is worthless
And each one is called.
#4
The Spirit's anointing
On all flesh comes down,
And we shall be channels
For works like His own.
#5
We come now believing
Your promise of power,
For we are Your people
And this is Your hour.
#6
The King is among us,
His Spirit is here,
Let's draw near and worship,
Let songs fill the air.
