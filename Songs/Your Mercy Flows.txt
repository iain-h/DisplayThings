Hear our cry, (echo)
O Lord, (echo)
Be merciful (echo)
Once more; (echo)
Let Your love (echo)
Your anger stem, (echo)
Remember mercy, O Lord, again.
#1
Your mercy flows upon us like a river.
Your mercy stands unshakeable and true.
Most holy God, of all good things the Giver,
We turn and lift our fervent prayer to You.
#2
Your church once great, though standing clothed in sorrow,
Is even still the bride that You adore;
Revive Your church, that we again may honour
Our God and King, our Master and our Lord.
#3
As we have slept, this nation has been taken
By every sin ever known to man;
So at its gates, though burnt by fire and broken,
In Jesus' name we come to take our stand.
