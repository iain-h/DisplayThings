The Almighty reigns.
Hallelujah, for the Lord our God

And give the glory unto Him.

Hallelujah, for the Lord our God
Died and rose again.
He has shed his blood and has
Cleared the way to our Father King
Let us rejoice and be glad
And give the glory unto Him.
Hallelujah, for the Lord our God
Died and rose again.
