And I surrender all to you all to you 
And I surrender all to you all to you
#1
I'm giving you my heart and all that is within 
I lay it down for the sake of you my King 
I'm giving you my dreams I'm laying down my rights 
I'm giving up my pride for the promise of new life
#2
I'm singing you this song I'm waiting at the cross 
And all the world holds dear I count it all as loss
For the sake of knowing you, for the glory of your name
To know the lasting joy, even sharing in your pain
