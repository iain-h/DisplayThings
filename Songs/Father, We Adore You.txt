You are the fountain of life,
You are the Fountain of life,
And as we drink, we are more than satisfied
By You, O Fountain of life.

Father, we adore You,
We are Your children gathered here;
To be with You is our delight,
A feast beyond compare.
#2
Father, in Your presence
There is such freedom to enjoy.
We find in You a lasting peace
That nothing can destroy.
