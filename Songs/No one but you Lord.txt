#C
Only you can fill my deepest longing,
Only you can breathe in me new life;
Only you can fill my heart with laughter,
Only you can answer my heart's cry.
#1
No one but you, Lord,
Can satisfy the longing in my heart.
Nothing I do, Lord,
Can take the place of drawing near to you.
#2
Father, I love you,
Come satisfy the longing in my heart.
Fill me, overwhelm me,
Until I know your love deep in my heart.
