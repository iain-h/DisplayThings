#1
How can I be free from sin?
Lead me to the cross of Jesus,
From the guilt, the pow'r, the pain,
Lead me to the cross of Jesus.
#2
There's no other way,
No price that I could pay,
Simply to the cross I cling.
This is all I need,
This is all I plead,
That His blood was shed for me.
#3
How can I know peace within?
Lead me to the cross of Jesus,
Sing a song of joy again,
Lead me to the cross of Jesus.
#4
Flowing from above,
All-forgiving love,
From the Father's heart to me.
What a gift of grace,
His own righteousness,
Clothing me in purity.
#5
How can I live day by day?
Lead me to the cross of Jesus,
Following His narrow way,
Lead me to the cross of Jesus.
