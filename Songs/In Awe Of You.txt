Now Your presence fills this place,
Be exalted in our praise.
As we worship I believe
You are near.
(Repeat)

In Awe Of You, we worship
And stand amazed at Your great love.
We're changed from glory to glory,
We set our hearts on You, our God.

Blessing and honour
And glory and power
Forever, forever.
