#1
We will glorify the king of kings,
We will glorify the Lamb;
We will glorify the Lord of lords,
Who is the great 'I Am'.
#2
Lord Jehovah reigns in majesty,
We will bow before His throne;
We will worship Him in righteousness,
We worship Him alone.
#3
He is Lord of heaven, Lord of earth,
He is Lord of all who live;
He is Lord above the universe,
All praise to Him we give.
#4
Hallelujah to the King of kings,
Hallelujah to the Lamb;
Hallelujah to the Lord of lords,
Who is the great 'l Am'.
