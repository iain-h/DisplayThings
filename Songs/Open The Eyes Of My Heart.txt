Open the eyes of my heart, Lord,
Open the eyes of my heart.
I want to see You,
I want to see You.
Open the eyes of my heart, Lord,
Open the eyes of my heart.
I want to see You,
I want to see You.
#2
To see You high and lifted up,
Shining in the light of Your glory.
Pour out Your power and love,
As we sing holy, holy, holy.
#3
Holy, holy, holy,
Holy, holy,holy,
Holy holy holy,
I want to see You.
