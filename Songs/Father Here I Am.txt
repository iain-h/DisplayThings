#C
To me, from me,
So my heart will know;
Fully and sweetly,
Let forgiveness flow.
#1
Father here I am again,
In need of mercy, hurt from sin,
So by the blood and Jesus' love,
Let forgiveness flow.
#2
In my heart and in my mind,
In word and deed, I've been so blind,
So by the blood and Jesus' love,
Let forgiveness flow.
