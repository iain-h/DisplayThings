All wisdom and honour and glory forever,
All power and greatness and splendour,
They are Yours above all others, my Lord.
#1
Lord, Your glory fills my heart,
Your presence deep within me stirs mysoul.
O Lord, how awesome are Your ways,
Your majesty surrounding all the earth.
#2
Lord, Your Spirit moves me now,
I see a picture of Your holiness.
O Lord, I look into Your eyes,
And feel a fire burn into my heart.
