Show Your glory, show Your glory,
Show Your glory over all the earth.
Show Your glory, show Your glory,
Show Your glory over all the earth.
#1
The Voice Of God is calling
With words that roar and rage;
The passion of the Father's heart
Resounds through every age.
Multitudes are waiting
For this gospel we proclaim;
Christ Jesus came among us
That all men might be saved.
#2
This is our commission,
To fill the air with praise
And to tell the people of this world
The glory of His name.
With thousands upon thousands
From every tribe and tongue
We cry, 'Worthy is the Lamb once slain,
For He has overcome!'
#3
With tears of intercession,
Through the prayers of all the saints,
We long to reach the nations
With humility and grace.
Come touch this generation
And use us, Lord, we pray;
Fill our hearts with boldness
To do the things You say.
