Over the heavens above,
Under the earth below,
Deeper than any sea
Shines the presence of Your glory.
A river with many streams
Flows to the heart of the holy King;
Full of such wonder and mystery,
Living in power and in glory.
Great are You Lord, and mighty,
Your splendour is reigning in the earth.
Your glory is revealed
In the hearts of those who You've redeemed.
Great are You, Lord, and mighty,
Great are You, Lord, and mighty.
