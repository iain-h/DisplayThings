We'll see it all (we'll see it all),
We'll see it all (we'll see it all),
We'll see it all (we'll see it all),
We'll see it all,
When the kingdom comes,
When Jesus comes,
When the kingdom comes,
When Jesus comes,
When the kingdom comes.
When Jesus comes,
When the kingdom comes,
When Jesus comes.
Your kingdom come,
Your will be done,
Your kingdom come,
Your will be done.
When the kingdom comes,
When Jesus comes,
When the kingdom comes,
When Jesus comes,
When the kingdom comes.
When Jesus comes,
When the kingdom comes,
When Jesus comes.

We must work together,
Bringing in the kingdom,
Bringing heaven here on earth.
Start a new world order,
Start a revolution,
Let all people know their worth.

We'll see it all (we'll see it all),
We'll see it all (we'll see it all),
We'll see it all (we'll see it all),
We'll see it all,

When the kingdom comes,
When Jesus comes,
When the kingdom comes,
When Jesus comes,

We will see the dawning,
In this generation
See the start of a new day.
We'll know peace and freedom.
We will know true laughter,
We'll see sickness blown away.
