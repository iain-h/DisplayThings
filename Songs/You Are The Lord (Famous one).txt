You are the Lord, the famous one, famous one
Great is Your name in all the earth
The Heavens declare you're glorious, glorious
Great is Your fame beyond the earth.
#1
And for all You've done and yet to do,
With every breath, I'm praising You.
Desire of nations and every heart,
You alone are God,
You alone are God.
#2
The Morning Star is shining through,
And every eye is watching You.
Revealed by nature and miracles,
You are beautiful, You are beautiful.
