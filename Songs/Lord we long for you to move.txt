Heal our nation!
Heal our nation!
Heal our nation!
Pour out your Spirit on this land!
#1
Lord, we long for you to move in power.
There's a hunger deep within our hearts
To see healing in our nation.
Send your Spirit to revive us.
#2
Lord, we hear your Spirit coming closer,
A mighty wave to break upon our land,
Bringing justice and forgiveness.
God, we cry to you, 'Revive us!'
