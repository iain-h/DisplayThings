Wake up, O sleeper,
And rise from the dead,
And Christ will shine on you.
Wake up, O sleeper,
And rise from the dead,
And Christ will shine on you.
#1
Once you were darkness, but now you are light,
Now you are light in the Lord.
So as true children of light you must live,
Showing the glory of God.
#2
This is the beautiful fruit of the light,
The good, the righteous, the true.
Let us discover what pleases the Lord
In everything we do.
#3
As days get darker, take care how you live,
Not as unwise, but as wise,
Making the most of each moment he gives,
And pressing on for the prize.
