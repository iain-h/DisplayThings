#C
Say it loud, say it strong,
Tell the world what God has done;
Say it loud, praise His name,
Let the earth rejoice
For the Lord reigns.
#1
Far and near hear the call,
Worship Him, Lord of all;
Families of nations come,
Celebrate what God has done.
#2
Deep and wide is the love
Heaven sent from above;
God's own Son for sinners died,
Rose again, He is alive.
#3
At His name let praise begin,
Oceans roar, nature sing.
For He comes to judge the earth
In righteousness and in His truth.
