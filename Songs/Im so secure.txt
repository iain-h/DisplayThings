So close I believe
You're holding me now,
In your hands I belong.
You'll never let me go.
So close I believe
You're holding me now,
In your hands I belong.
You'll never let me go.
#1
I'm so secure,
You're here with me;
You stay the same,
Your love remains
Here in my heart.
#2
You gave your life
In your endless love;
You set me free
And showed the way:
Now I am found.
#3
All along, you were beside me,
Even when I couldn't tell.
Through the years you showed me
More of you, more of you.
