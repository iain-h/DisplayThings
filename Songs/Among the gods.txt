For you are great
And do marvellous deeds.
Yes, you are great
And do marvellous deeds.
You alone are God, you alone are God.
#1
Among the gods
There is none like you, O Lord, O Lord.
There are no deeds
To compare with yours, O Lord.
All the nations you have made will come;
They'll worship before you, O Lord, O Lord.
#2
You are so good
And forgiving, O Lord, O Lord.
You're rich in love
To all who call to you, O Lord.
All the nations you have made will come;
They'll glorify your name, O Lord, O Lord.
#3
Teach me your ways, O Lord,
And I'll walk in your truth.
Give me an undivided heart,
That I may fear your name.
