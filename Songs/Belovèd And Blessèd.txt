You're unchanging, You're magnificent,
You are all I could desire.
You're my Breath of life,
Sun of righteousness,
You're the Love that satisfies.
#1
Belovèd and blessèd,
The Father's pure delight.
Redeemer, Sustainer,
You're my passion and my prize.
#2
My Brother, my Comforter,
My Shepherd and my Friend.
My Ransom, my Righteousness,
You're the Stream that never ends.
#3
There's kindness, compassion
For those who will draw near;
Acceptance, forgiveness,
And a love that conquers fear.
#B
You're the Word of life,
You're the Bread of heaven,
You're the Lion and the Lamb.
All within me cries,
'Lord be glorified
By everything I am.'
