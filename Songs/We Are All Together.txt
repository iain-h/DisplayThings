Lord, we welcome You,
We welcome You,
We welcome You,
Come fill this place.
#1
We are all together
To call upon Your name;
There is nothing we like better
Than to sing and give You praise.
#2
Bring healing and salvation,
Let Your kingdom come
Right here just like in heaven,
Lord, may Your will be done.
#3
Father, come fill this place,
We welcome You;
Jesus, we seek Your face,
'Cause all we want to do
Is give our love to You.
