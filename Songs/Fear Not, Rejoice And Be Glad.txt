Fear not, rejoice and be glad,
The Lord hath done a great thing;
Hath poured out His Spirit on all mankind,
On those who confess His name.
#1
The fig tree is budding, the vine beareth fruit,
The wheat fields are golden with grain.
Thrust in the sickle, the harvest is ripe,
The Lord has given us rain.
#2
Ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied,
The mountains will drip with sweet wine.
My children shall drink of the fountain of life,
My children will know they are Mine.
#3
My children shall dwell in a Body of love,
A light to the world they will be.
Life shall come forth from the Father above,
My Body will set mankind free.
