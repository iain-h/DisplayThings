#1
Oh Kneel Me Down Again,
Here at Your feet;
Show me how much You love humility.
Oh Spirit, be the star that leads me to
The humble heart of love I see in You.
#2
You are the God of the broken,
The friend of the weak;
You wash the feet of the weary,
Embrace the ones in need.
I want to be like You, Jesus,
To have this heart in me.
You are the God of the humble,
You are the humble King.
