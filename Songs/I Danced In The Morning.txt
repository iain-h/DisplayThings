'Dance, then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,' said He,
'And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,' said He.

I Danced In The Morning when the world was begun,
And I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun,
And I came down from heaven and I danced on the earth:
At Bethlehem I had My birth.
#2
'I danced for the scribe and the pharisee,
But they would not dance and they wouldn't follow Me.
I danced for the fishermen, for James and John -
They came with Me and the dance went on.
#3
'I danced on the Sabbath and I cured the lame;
The holy people said it was a shame.
They whipped and they stripped and they hung Me on high,
And they left Me there on a cross to die.
#4
'I danced on a Friday when the sky turned black;
It's hard to dance with the devil on your back.
They buried My body and they thought I'd gone,
But I am the dance, and I still go on.
#5
'They cut Me down and I leapt up high;
I am the life that'll never, never die.
I'll live in you if you'll live in Me;
I am the Lord of the dance', said He.
