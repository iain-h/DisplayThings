Heavenly Father, we are waiting
Longing for anticipating
The moving of your spirit in this place
Heavenly Father, move upon us
Pour your gracious love down on us
As we stand in wonder of your grace
#2
We come to you with open hearts
To receive all the love that you give
We come to you in whole not part
For you give us life, in you we live
