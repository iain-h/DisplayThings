#1
Let The Weak Say I Am Strong,
Let the poor say I am rich,
Let the blind say I can see,
It's what the Lord has done in me.
(Repeat)
#2
Hosanna, hosanna
To the Lamb that was slain;
Hosanna, hosanna,
Jesus died and rose again.
#3
Into the river I will wade,
There my sins are washed away;
From the heavens mercy streams
Of the Saviour's love for me.
#4
I will rise from waters deep
Into the saving arms of God;
I will sing salvation songs:
Jesus Christ has set me free.
