Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee!
And though it be
A cross that raises me:
Still all my song would be,
'Nearer, my God, to thee.
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee.'
#2
Though, like the wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone;
Yet in my dreams I'd be
Nearer, my God, to thee.
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee!
#3
There let the way appear,
Steps unto heav'n;
All that thou sendest me
In mercy giv'n:
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to thee.
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee!
#4
Then, with my waking thoughts
Bright with thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I'll raise;
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to thee.
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee.
#5
Or if on joyful wing
Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon and stars forgot,
Upwards I fly,
Still all my song shall be,
'Nearer, my God, to thee.
Nearer, my God, to thee,
Nearer to thee.'
