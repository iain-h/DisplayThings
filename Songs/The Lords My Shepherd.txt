#1
The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want.
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green. He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.
#2
My soul he doth restore again,
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness,
E'en for His own name's sake.
#3
Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,
Yet will I fear none ill.
For thou art with me, and thy rod
And staff me comfort still.
#4
My table thou hast furnish\'ded
In presence of my foes:
My head thou dost with oil anoint,
And my cup overflows.
#5
Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me.
And in God's house for evermore
My dwelling-place shall be.
