To the ends of the earth,
To the ends of the earth,
To the ends of the earth we will go;
Bearing the message
That our God can be known,
To the ends of the earth we will go.
#1
The waves are breaking, the tide is turning,
God's Spirit is coming to this earth;
The harvest is waiting,
And we have been called
To go to the nations of this world.
#2
The fire is falling, the wind is blowing,
The flame is spreading across our land;
Revival is coming, let the world hear,
Tell every woman, child and man.
#3
The drums are beating,
The trumpet is sounding,
A warrior spirit He's put in our hearts;
In the name of the Father, Spirit and Son,
We'll take this word to everyone.
