And he made us for His delight,
Gave us the gift of life,
Created us family to be His glory,
To be His glory.

Men: The Lord is a mighty King,
Women: the Maker of everything.
Men: The Lord, he made the earth,
Women: he spoke and it came at once to birth.
Men: He said, 'Let us make mankind',
Women: the crown of His design,
Men: 'in our own likeness',
Women: His image in every human face.
#2
Men: And yet we were deceived,
Women: in pride the lie believed,
Men: to sin and death's decay û
Women: the whole creation fell that day.
Men: Now all creation
Women: yearns for liberation;
Men: all things in Christ restored û
Women: the purchase of His precious blood.
#3
Shout:
For by him
All things were created.
Things in heaven
And on earth.
Visible and invisible.
Whether thrones
Or powers
Or rulers
Or authorities;
All things were created by him,
And for him.
