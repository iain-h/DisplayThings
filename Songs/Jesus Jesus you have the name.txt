Jesus (Jesus), Jesus (Jesus).
You have the name
That's higher than all other names.
Jesus (Jesus), Jesus (Jesus).
You are the King,
The mighty God, the one who reigns.
Glorious in splendour and majesty,
Clothed with the robe of authority.
Jesus, my King, you will always be
My deepest joy,
My one desire.
O Prince of Peace,
You set my heart on fire.
