#1
Son of man and man of heaven,
Full of grace and truth;
Sinner's friend yet without sin,
I want to be like You:
Perfect in holiness,
Full of faithfulness and love.
#2
I want to be like Jesus,
I want to be like Jesus,
I want to be like You,
O Lord, our God.
(Repeat)
#3
You began a work in me,
I know You'll see it through.
There's a new song in my heart,
And I want to sing to You.
You lifted me from mire,
From sin and from shame You set me free,
And I know Your tenderness,
I know Your power at work in me.
#4
You're making me like Jesus
You're making me like Jesus
You're making me like You
O Lord, our God.
(Repeat)
