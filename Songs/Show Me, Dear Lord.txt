I am yours because You have chosen me.
I'm Your child because You've called my name,
And Your steadfast love will never change;
I will always be Your precious child.
#1
Show me, dear Lord, how You see me in Your eyes,
So that I can realise Your great love for me.
Teach me, O Lord, that I am precious in Your sight,
That as a father loves his child, so You love me.
#2
Show me, dear Lord, that I can never earn Your love,
That a gift cannot be earned, only given.
Teach me, O Lord, that Your love will never fade,
That I can never drive away Your great mercy.
