#1
Jesus Christ Is Waiting, waiting in the streets;
No one is His neighbour, all alone He eats.
Listen, Lord Jesus, I am lonely too:
Make me, friend or stranger, fit to wait on You.
#2
Jesus Christ is raging, raging in the streets,
Where injustice spirals and real hope retreats.
Listen, Lord Jesus, I am angry too:
In the kingdom's causes, let me rage with You.
#3
Jesus Christ is healing, healing in the streets,
Curing those who suffer, touching those He greets.
Listen, Lord Jesus, I have pity too:
Let my care be active, healing just like You.
#4
Jesus Christ is dancing, dancing in the streets,
Where each sign of hatred He, with love, defeats.
Listen, Lord Jesus, I should triumph too:
Where good conquers evil, let me dance with You.
#5
Jesus Christ is calling, calling in the streets:
'Who will join My journey? I will guide their feet.'
Listen, Lord Jesus, let my fears be few:
Walk one step before me; I will follow You.
