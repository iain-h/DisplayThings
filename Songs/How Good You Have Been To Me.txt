I live for You,
I place no one above You.
I'll walk with You always, always.
To talk with You,
And feel Your breath on my face,
How amazing,
How amazing You are!
#1
How Good You Have Been To Me,
Forever faithful.
How true are Your promises,
Never shaken.
You are the Light of my life,
You are the reason I live.
#2
How rich is Your word, O Lord,
At work within me.
How soft is Your voice I hear,
That gently calls me.
Each day I wake to Your love;
I know that I am blessed of God!
