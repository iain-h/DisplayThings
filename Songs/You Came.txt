And we will fill the earth with the love of God
That's been shed abroad in our hearts,
Share with every nation and every land
The grace that He imparts.
And we will sing a new song of joy and peace,
A resounding trumpet call,
Causing hearts to rise, opening eyes to see
That Jesus, Jesus is Lord of all.
#1
You came to heal the brokenhearted;
You came to make the blind eyes see.
Your light is burning now within us,
As Your word of truth sets us free.
#2
You come in all Your mighty power,
You come to bring the latter rain;
We know You've filled us with Your Spirit
And a love we cannot contain.
#3
You'll come in glory and splendour,
You'll come to reign upon the earth;
We know we'll live with You forever
And declare Your mighty worth.
