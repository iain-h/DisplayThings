Follow Him, follow Him, yield your life to Him,
He has conquered death, He is King of kings;
Accept the joy which He gives to those
Who yield their lives to Him.
#1
I want to walk with Jesus Christ
All the days I live of this life on earth;
To give to Him complete control
Of body and of soul
#2
I want to learn to speak to Him,
To pray to Him, confess my sin;
To open my life and let Him in,
For joy will then be mine:
#3
I want to learn to speak of Him,
My life must show that He lives in me;
My deeds, my thoughts, my words must speak
All of His love for me:
#4
I want to learn to read His word,
For this is how I know the way
To live my life as pleases Him,
In holiness and joy:
#5
O Holy Spirit of the Lord,
Enter now into this heart of mine;
Take full control of my selfish will,
And make me wholly Thine:
