#1
Safe in the shadow of the Lord,
Beneath His hand and power,
I trust in Him,
I trust in Him,
My fortress and my tower.
#2
My hope is set on God alone,
Though Satan spreads his snare,
I trust in Him,
I trust in Him,
To keep me in His care.
#3
From fears and phantoms of the night,
From foes about my way,
I trust in Him,
I trust in Him,
By darkness as by day.
#4
His holy angels keep my feet
Secure from every stone;
I trust in Him,
I trust in Him,
And unafraid go on.
#5
Strong in the everlasting Name,
And in my Father's care,
I trust in Him,
I trust in Him,
Who hears and answers prayer.
#6
Safe in the shadow of the Lord,
Possessed by love divine,
I trust in Him,
I trust in Him,
And meet His love with mine.
