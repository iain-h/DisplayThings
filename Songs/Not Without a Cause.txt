'not without a right do we unsheath our silent swords,
Not without a fight but we will crown Him Lord of lords.
Lift your banner, lift it high, Jesus is our battle cry.
As we've lived, so we shall die, by His side.'

Not without a cause do we go marching forth to war,
Not without a cause that we'll see righteousness restored.
Clean your weapons, stir your hearts, shed all fears before we start,
When we stand to do our part we shall say:
#2
Not without a foe do we prepare ourselves to fight,
Not without a shout will we scale hell's unconquered height.
Let the hosts of Satan pray, when we rise as one that day,
Let them run in disarray, when we say:
#3
Not without a cheer will we hear bells and trumpets ring,
Not without a tear we'll set Him on the throne of kings.
Eyes on fire and faces grim, we will free Jerusalem,
Through the gates we'll follow Him, as we say:
