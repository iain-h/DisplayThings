God is with us, alleluia. (men)
God is with us, alleluia. (Women)
Come to save us, alleluia. (Men)
Come to save us, (Women)
Alleluia! (All).
#1
Like a candle flame,
Flickering small in our darkness.
Uncreated light
Shines through infant eyes.
#2
Stars and angels sing,
Yet the earth sleeps in shadows;
Can this tiny spark
Set a world on fire?
#3
Yet His light shall shine
From our lives, Spirit blazing,
As we touch the flame
Of His holy fire.
