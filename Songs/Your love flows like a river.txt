As I worship you,
Come fill me with your love,
Flow over me.
As I lift your name
For all the world to see,
Flow over me.
As I bless you, Lord,
With all that's in my heart.
Jesus, my King,
O eternal One,
My sacrificial Lamb,
Flow over me.

Flows like a fountain into the sea.

Filling my spirit, making me clean.Your love flows like a river,
Flows like a fountain into the sea.
Your love washes me over,
Filling my spirit, making me clean.

Your touch, taking me over,
Leading me gently into your arms.

Healing my spirit, restoring my soul.

Flow over me,
River, flow over me,
River, flow over me,
Flow over me.
Jesus, wash over me,
Wash over me,
Wash over me,
Flow over me.
Fill me with your love,
Spirit, fill me with your love,
Fill me with your love,
Flow over me.
