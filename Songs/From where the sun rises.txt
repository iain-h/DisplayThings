Even in the night when the sun goes down,
We're giving you praise;
Passing it along as the world goes round,
We're giving you praise.
#1
From where the sun rises,
Even to the place it goes down -
We're giving you praise,
Giving you praise.
From sun-kissed islands
And even where the cold wind blows -
We're giving you praise,
Giving you praise.
#2
We're lifting our faces,
Looking at the One we all love -
We're giving you praise,
Giving you praise.
All colours and races
Joining with the angels above -
We're giving you praise,
Giving you praise.
