O God, let us be
A generation that seeks,
That seeks Your face,
O God of Jacob.
(Repeat)
#1
We Bow Our Hearts,
We bend our knees;
O Spirit, come make us humble.
We turn our eyes from evil things;
O Lord, we cast down our idols.
#2
Give us clean hands,
Give us pure hearts;
Let us not lift our souls to another.
(Repeat)
