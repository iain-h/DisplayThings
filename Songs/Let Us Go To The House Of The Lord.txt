I rejoiced with those who said to me,
'Let us go to the house of the Lord.'
Our feet are standing in your gates, Jerusalem;
Like a city built together,
Where the people of God go up
To praise the name of the Lord.
#2
For peace for all Jerusalem
And loved ones this we pray;
May all men be secure where they must live.
And to all my friends and brothers,
May the peace be within you
For the sake of the house of the Lord.
