I love You, love You, jesus.
Yes, I love You, love You, Jesus,
My King.

You are my king, (you are my king)
And I love You.
You are my King, (You are my King)
And I worship You.
#2
Kneeling before You now,
All of my life I gladly give to You.
Placing my hopes and dreams
In Your hands,
I give my heart to You.
