Jesus, the very thought of Thee
With sweetness fills the breast;
But sweeter far Thy face to see,
And in Thy presence rest.
#2
Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,
Nor can the memory find
A sweeter sound than Thy blessed name,
O Saviour of mankind!
#3
O hope of every contrite heart,
O joy of all the meek,
To those who fall how kind Thou art,
How good to those who seek!
#4
But what to those who find? Ah, this
Nor tongue nor pen can show:
The love of Jesus, what it is
None but His loved ones know.
#5
Jesus, Thy mercies are untold
Through each returning day;
Thy love exceeds a thousandfold
Whatever we can say.
#6
Jesus, our only joy be Thou,
As Thou our prize wilt be;
Jesus, be Thou our glory now,
And through eternity.
