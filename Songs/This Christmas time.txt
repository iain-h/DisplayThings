Merry Christmas to you
Merry Christmas everybody
Here's to friends old and new
And to this Christmas time
#1
In a cold stone church under moon and stars
People stand as the organ starts
And the candles flicker into dark
This Christmas time
#2
There's a child awake in her bed upstairs
Snuggled up with her teddy bears
As she thinks of presents, she says her prayers
This Christmas time
#3
In a steamy kitchen a mother stands
Peeling parsnips and boiling ham
How she hopes the dinner will go to plan
This Christmas time
#4
In an empty street under cloudless skies
Sits an old man with bundle tied
And he huddles down for another night
This Christmas time
#5
In an empty street under cloudless skies
Sits an old man with bundle tied
And he huddles down for another night
This Christmas time
#6
#7
#B
Here's to the message the angels sang
Here's to the Saviour who came for all men
Born for you and for me
For strangers and friends
