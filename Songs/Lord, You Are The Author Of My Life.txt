#1
Lord, You are the author of my life,
You have begun a work in me,
You have predestined me
To do Your perfect will.
And Lord, You are the Lord of all my days,
You are the Lord of all my nights,
You have chosen me
To carry forth Your word.
#2
So Lord, finish in me what You've begun,
Guide me by Your mighty hand, Lord:
Let me trust in You.
And Lord, let me seek Your holy face,
May I always walk with You, Lord,
And let Your will be done.
