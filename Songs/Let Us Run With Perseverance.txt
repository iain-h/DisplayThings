Let Us Run With Perseverance
The race set out before us;
Let us fix our eyes on Jesus,
The Author and Perfecter of our faith.
#1
In the beginning
The Word was with God,
Through Him all of us were made;
He began a work in us,
A good work to perfect
Until He returns again.
#2
Since we are surrounded
By heaven's cheering crowd,
Let us throw off every chain:
For all that opposes us,
Look to Jesus who endured
So we'll not lose heart again.
#3
For the joy before Him,
He suffered the cross,
He defeated death and shame;
Now He reigns in glory
At the right hand of God -
He is calling us by name.
