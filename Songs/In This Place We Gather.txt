#1
In This Place We Gather
To worship You together,
To come before You, holy God.
(Repeat)
#2
And as we seek Your face,
Let this be Your dwelling place,
We have come to worship You.
We come to give our all,
It's at Your feet we fall,
We have come to praise You.
#3
We have come to worship,
We have come to worship,
We have come to worship You.
