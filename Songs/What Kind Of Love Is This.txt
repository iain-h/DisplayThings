What kind of love is this
That gave itself for me?
I am the guilty one,
Yet I go free.
What kind of love is this,
A love I've never known?
I didn't even know His name.
What kind of love is this?
#2
What kind of man is this
That died in agony?
He who had done no wrong
Was crucified for me.
What kind of man is this
Who laid aside His throne,
That I may know the love of God?
What kind of man is this?
#3
By grace I have been saved;
It is the gift of God.
He destined me to be His child,
Such is His love.
No eye has ever seen,
No ear has ever heard,
Nor has the heart of man conceived
What kind of love is this.
