You're alive, you're alive,
You have risen, alleluia!
And the pow'r and the glory is given,
Alleluia! Jesus to you.
#1
Led like a lamb to the slaughter
In silence and shame,
There on your back you carried
A world of violence and pain.
Bleeding, dying, bleeding, dying.
#2
At break of dawn, poor Mary,
Still weeping she came,
When through her grief she heard your voice
Now speaking her name.
(Men) Mary,
(Women) Master,
(Men) Mary,
(Women) Master.
#3
At the right hand of the Father
Now seated on high
You have begun your eternal reign
Of justice and joy.
Glory, glory, glory, glory.
