#1
Here I Am, O God,
I bring this sacrifice,
My open heart, I offer up my life.
I look to You, Lord,
Your love that never ends
Restores me again.
#2
So I lift my eyes to You, Lord,
In Your strength I will break through, Lord.
Touch me now, let Your love fall down on me.
I know Your love dispels all my fears.
Through the storm I will hold on, Lord,
And by faith I will walk on, Lord,
Then I'll see beyond my Calvary one day,
And I will be complete in You.
