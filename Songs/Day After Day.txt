So keep my heart pure,
And my ways true,
As I follow You.
Keep me humble,
I'll stay mindful
Of Your mercies, Lord.
#1
Day After Day, I'll search to find You;
Day after day, I'll wait for You.
The deeper I go, the more I love Your name.
#2
I'll cherish Your word,
I'll seek Your presence,
I'll chase after You with all I have.
As one day I know
I'll see You face to face.
