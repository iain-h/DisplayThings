#1
Heaven invites you to a party,
To celebrate the birth of a Son;
Angels rejoicing in the starlight,
Singing, 'Christ your Saviour has come.'
(Repeat)
#2
And it's for you (and it's for you)
And it's for me (and it's for me),
For all your friends (for all your friends)
And family (and family).
#3
Now heaven's door (now heaven's door)
Is open wide (is open wide),
So come on in (so come on in),
Come, step inside (come, step inside).
#4
Angels from the realms of glory,
Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
You who sang creation's story,
Now proclaim Messiah's birth.
And it's for you . . .
#5
Let trumpets blast (let trumpets blast),
Let music play (let music play),
Let people shout (let people shout),
Let banners wave (let banners wave).
#6
Come, all you people (come, all you people),
Join hands together (join hands together),
Bring all your neighbours
(bring all your neighbours),
Everybody! (everybody!)
