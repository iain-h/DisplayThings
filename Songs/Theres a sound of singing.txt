We rejoice in you,
Give our lives to you.
We rejoice in you
And we testify
That this love is true
With the sound of singing.
#1
There's a sound of singing in our midst,
There's an offering of praise.
We set our hearts towards you, Lord,
With our lips our songs we raise.
There is jubilation in the camp
For your promises are true,
And by your grace salvation comes
To bring us home to you.
#2
With our lives we humbly bow to you,
And standing in this place
Our songs express our hearts' desire
To serve you all our days.
We will honour you and magnify
Your name above all names,
For we know there is no other God,
Yes, you are the King of kings.
#3
Our hearts are filled with gladness
And a sacrifice of praise,
For you have done great things for us.
So glad that you have called us
And what else can we say,
You've saved us by your grace.
