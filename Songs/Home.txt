Home is Heaven one day Lord I will live
In your courts you'll find me
In worship at your feet
Hide me now in the shadow of your wings
Where I will be, where I will be
#1
Into your courts I run with praises
Flowing from my heart
Every day I wake I sing your song
It's the anthem of my life.
#2
I want to spend my days in your presence Lord
Bowed before your throne
In the house of God is where I find my peace
It's where I find my....
#3
Your love is all I need
So desperately I have sought your face
I know you hear my every cry
And petition that I make.
