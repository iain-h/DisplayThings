Oh Outrageous Grace!
Oh Outrageous Grace!
Love unfurled by Heavens hand
Oh Outrageous Grace!
Oh Outrageous Grace!
Through my Jesus I can stand
#1
There's a lot of pain
But a lot more healing
There's a lot of trouble
But a lot more peace
There's a lot of hate
But a lot more loving
There's a lot of sin
But a lot more grace
#2
There's a lot of fear
But a lot more freedom
There's a lot of darkness
But a lot more light
There's a lot of cloud
But a lot more vision
There's a lot of perishing
But a lot more Life!
