Satan is defeated,
Christ has overcome,
Seated at the Father's hand,
Lord, on earth may Your will now be done.
#1
We will tear down every stronghold
Through the power of His word.
We will seek to bring His kingdom in,
Make a way for His return.
#2
We will tell of His salvation,
For the church of Christ is called
To bring healing to the nations,
See His righteousness restored.
