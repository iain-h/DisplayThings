Mercy, mercy, Lord,
Your mercy is how we are restored;
Mercy, O mercy, Lord,
Help us to show Your mercy, Lord.
#1
You have been patient with our offences,
You have forgiven all of our sins;
We were deserving only Your judgement,
But Your great mercy triumphed again.
#2
Lord, You have taught us, 'Love one another,'
As You have loved us so we must love;
Always forbearing, always forgiving,
Showing to others the mercy we've known.
