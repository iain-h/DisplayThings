How firm a foundation,
You saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith
In His excellent word;
What more can he say
Than to you he has said,
You who unto Jesus
For refuge have fled?
#2
Fear not, I am with you,
O be not dismayed;
For I am your God,
And will still give you aid;
I'll strengthen you, help you,
And cause you to stand,
Upheld by my righteous,
Omnipotent hand.
#3
In every condition,
In sickness, in health,
In poverty's vale,
Or abounding in wealth;
At home and abroad,
On the land, on the sea,
As your days may demand
Shall your strength ever be.
#4
When through the deep waters
I call you to go,
The rivers of grief
Shall not you overflow;
For I will be with you
In trouble to bless,
And sanctify to you
Your deepest distress.
#5
When through fiery trials
Your pathway shall lie,
My grace all-sufficient
Shall be your supply;
The flame shall not hurt you,
My only design
Your dross to consume
And your gold to refine.
#6
The soul that on Jesus
Has leaned for repose
I will not, I cannot,
Desert to its foes;
That soul, though all hell
Should endeavour to shake,
I never will leave,
I will never forsake.
