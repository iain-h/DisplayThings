He picked me up
And He dusted me down,
Put my feet back on solid ground.
He welcomed me home
And He caused me to sing,
I'm in love, I'm in love with the King.
#1
For all my days I'll sing His praise,
I'm so grateful.
Yes, I will give my everything
To the One who sets me free.
#2
Once I was lost, but now I'm found,
Yes, He saved me.
He called my name and my life was changed
By the power of His love.
