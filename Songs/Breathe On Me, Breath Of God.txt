#1
Breathe on me, breath of God,
And fill my life anew;
That I may love as You love,
And do the works that You do.
Holy Spirit, breathe on me.
#2
Breathe on me, breath of God,
Until my heart is pure;
Until my will is one with Yours
Let holiness and love endure.
Holy Spirit, breathe on me.
#3
And let every part of me
Glow with fire divine;
With passion in my life,
Jesus, let Your glory shine.
(Repeat)
