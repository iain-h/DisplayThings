What Can I Say but 'I love You'?
What can I say but 'I praise You'?
As the train of Your robe fills this temple,
As the sound of Your voice fills this place.
What can I do but to bow down?
What can I do but to worship?
Only You are the One who is worthy,
Only You are the One who is Lord.

Great is the Lord, so great is the Lord,
Righteous and true God, holy and pure.
I fall on my knees confessing my need
For more of Your presence, Lord.
