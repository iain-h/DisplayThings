I want to know You better,
The Spirit without measure,
To know the fulness that's in You.
I want to know Your mystery,
The grace You've given freely,
I know my life is hidden in You.
#1
I want to know
The glorious inheritance
That You have given to me.
And I want to know
The hope that You have called me to,
O Lord, I want to know Your truth.
#2
I want to know
Your wisdom and Your revelation,
Drawing me to You.
I want to know
The power of Your mighty strength
Which raised
Jesus from the dead.
