And I'll sing, sing 
I love you so
And I'll sing, because the world can't take away
Your love

It used to be darkness
Without you
I lived my life in blindness
But now I'm found
#2
Found me in weakness, broken
You came to me in kindness
And now I live

I'll give my life for you Lord
For all you've done
