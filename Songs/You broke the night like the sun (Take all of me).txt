I love you.
All of my hope is in you.
Jesus Christ take my life take all of me
#1
You broke the night like the sun
And healed my heart with your great love
Any trouble I couldn't bear
You lifted me upon your shoulders
#2
You stand upon mountain tops with me
With You I walk through the valleys
You gave Your only Son for me
Your grace is all I rely on

Love that's stronger
Love that covers sin
And takes the weight of the world
