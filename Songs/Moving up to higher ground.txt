Jesus gave his life for me
Now I'm saved, I am free
To live for him and look ahead
To all he has in store
I am his in Christ I'm found
I'm moving up to higher ground
I'm stepping out, I'm rising up
To more than I imagine
#1
I live by faith in Christ my saviour
This world can hold me down no more
I look around and see the emptiness 
In a life of doubt that I lived before
And the life I live's not mine I know for sure
#2
I'm pressing on to be like Jesus
To gain the prize awaiting me
So now I live a life of purpose
For the Lord is God and all he has is mine
And I choose to live my life to his design
