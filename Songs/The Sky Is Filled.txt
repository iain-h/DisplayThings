Emmanuel.
Emmanuel.
Emmanuel.
#1
The sky is filled with the glory of God.
Triumphantly the angels sing:
'Rejoice, good news, a Saviour is born,
And life will never be the same.'
#2
Praise and adoration spring from our hearts,
We lift our voices unto You;
You are the One, God's only Son,
King of kings forever more!
