#1
The nations are waiting for us,
They're dying to hear the song we sing.
The nations are waiting for us,
Waiting for the gospel we will bring,
That in each nation men might come to know the King.
Jesus, You lead us,
Calling us onward,
A glorious army
With banners unfurled.
#2
It's our decision
To follow Your vision,
We're on a mission,
A mission to the world.
And the nations are waiting,
The nations are waiting,
Waiting.
