This God is our God,
God of power, God of might.
This God is our God,
God of wisdom and light.
(Repeat)
#1
And we meditate on Your great love,
Your praises fill the earth.
The villages of Judah shout
That you will be, forever be
Our guide unto the end.
#2
As we have heard, so we have seen
The safety of our God,
That we might tell all generations
You will be, forever be
Our guide unto the end.
