Creation praise will thunder to You,
Thunder to You, thunder to You.
Creation praise will thunder to You.
I'm lost in the wonder,
Lost in the wonder of You.
#1
God Of The Mountains,
God of the sea;
God of the heavens
Of eternity.
God of the future,
God of the past;
God of the present,
God of all history.
#2
Wisdom of ages,
Light in the dark;
Home for the outcast,
Peace for the heart.
Friend of the lonely,
Strength for oppressed;
Voice of the voiceless,
God of all liberty.
