Hallelujah, hosanna,
Hallelujah, hosanna!

God has exalted Jesus to the highest place,
And given Him the name that is above every name,
That at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow
And every tongue confess that He is Lord.
#2
Hallalango Jesu, hallalango Jesu,
Hallalango Jesu, hallala O hallala.
Hallalango Jesu, hallalango Jesu,
Hallalango Jesu, Nkosi!
