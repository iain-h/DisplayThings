#1
Spirit Of The Lord, come down among us now;
Minister new life to bones grown dry.
Something in our heart cries out to be made whole:
The touch of healing love.
#2
Give us just a glimpse of God, of Jesus' heart,
Open ears to hear the voice say, 'Come':
Look up, look up, look up and see
The light of healing love.
