You are magnificent, eternally
Wonderful, glorious
Jesus
No one ever will compare
To you Jesus

Who compares to you?
Who set the stars in their place?
You who calmed the raging seas
That came crashing over me
Who compares to you?
You who bring the morning light
The hope of all the earth
Is rest assured in your great love

When the evening fades
You call forth songs of joy
As the morning wakes
We your children give you praise
