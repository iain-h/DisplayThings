#C
You're my shelter through it all,
You're my refuge and my strength,
Lord, I hide in the shadow of your wings.
(Repeat)
#1
My spirit rests in you alone,
You're all I know.
Embrace and touch me
Like a child,
I'm safe in you.
#2
My Lord, you're faithful,
You supply all good things,
You know completely
All my thoughts,
My deepest needs.
