#C
We lift up a shout,
A victory shout,
For we've overcome
By the blood of the Lamb
And the word of our mouth.
We've declared war
In the name of the Lord,
We've laid down our lives
That the triumph of Christ
May resound in the earth.
#1
We march to the tune of a love-song,
Singing the King's jubilee;
Anointed to enter the hell-gate,
Anointed to set captives free.
We lift up our banner of worship
And Jesus our Champion we praise;
An army of worshippers stand by His side,
Baptised in His fire,
Revealing His glorious light.
#2
We sing the high praises of heaven
And fight with the sword of the Word;
To bind every stronghold of Satan,
Preparing the way of the Lord.
We lift up a standard of worship
That shatters the darkness with light,
And God will arise on the wings of our praise
And march as a Warrior
Who's mighty and able to save.
