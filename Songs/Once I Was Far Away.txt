No height, no depth can keep us
From the love of Christ.
No life, no death, no trial
Can tear us from
The love of God in Christ.
#1
Once I Was Far Away,
But now my life is found in You.
Once I was without hope,
But now I have a vision of heaven.
#2
Fallen from grace;
By faith lifted up;
Now I believe
#3
How wonderful the love
Our Father God has given us,
That we could still be called
Children of God.
