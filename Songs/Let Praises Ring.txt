Let praises ring, let praises ring
To our glorious King.
#1
Let praises ring, let praises ring,
Lift voices up to love Him,
Lift hearts and hands to touch Him,
O let praises ring.
And fill the skies with anthems high
That tell His excellencies,
As priests and kings who rule with Him
Through all eternity;
#2
Let praises ring, let praises ring,
Bow down in adoration,
Cry out His exaltation,
O let praises ring.
And lift the Name above all names
Till every nation knows
The love of God has come to men,
His mercies overflow.
