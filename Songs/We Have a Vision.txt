We have a vision for this nation;
We share a dream for this land.
We join with angels in celebration,
By faith we speak revival to this land.
#2
Where every knee shall bow and worship You,
And every tongue confess that You are Lord;
Give us an open heaven, anoint our prayers this day,
And move Your sovereign hand across this nation.
