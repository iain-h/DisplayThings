#1
Father, I want you to hold me,
I want to rest in your arms today.
Father, I want you to show me,
How much you care for me
In every way.
I bring all my cares
And I lay them at your feet.
You are always there,
And you love me as I am,
Yes, you love me as I am.
#2
Father, I know you will hold me,
I know I am your child, your own.
Father, I know you will show me,
I feel your arms holding me,
I'm not alone.
I bring all my fears
And I lay them at your feet.
You are always here,
And you love me as I am,
Yes, you love me as I am.
