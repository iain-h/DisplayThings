Jesus, You alone are holy
You alone are holy 
Name above every name 
Lord Jesus, you alone are worthy 
You alone are worthy 
Jesus the lamb that was slain
#1
I will love you Lord, my strength
I belong to you
I will bless you while I live and I will 
Lift my hands up in your name

Nailed to the cross for me
Died and rose again
You redeemed me to the Father
By your blood you cleansed me from all sin
