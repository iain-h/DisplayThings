The Lord reigns, the Lord reigns,
The Lord reigns,
Let the earth rejoice, let the earth rejoice,
Let the earth rejoice,
Let the people be glad that our God reigns.
(Repeat)
#1
A fire goes before him
And burns up all His enemies;
The hills melt like wax at the presence of the Lord,
At the presence of the Lord.
#2
The heav'ns declare His righteousness,
The peoples see His glory;
For you, O Lord, are exalted over all the earth,
Over all the earth.
