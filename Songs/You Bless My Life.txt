All I can say is I love You.
All I can say is I need You.
All I can say is I thank You, Lord,
For all that You've done in my life.
#1
You bless my life, and heal me inside,
Over and over again.
You touched my heart and brought peace of mind,
Over and over again.
#2
You've been so kind and patient with me,
Over and over again.
When I have strayed You showed me the way,
Over and over again.
