You are my inspiration, You cause me to sing.
You are my inspiration, the reason I live.
You are my inspiration, I'm glad I'm alive.
You are my inspiration.
#1
You Are The Song That I Sing,
A precious melody.
You are the theme of my heart.
You are my inspiration.
#2
You are the light of my life,
How I love Your word.
It leads me closer to You.
#3
Your greatness creation displays,
Such wonders to behold.
In awe I, I live my days.
#4
How then can I be silent,
When my heart is so full?
In You I have discovered
The secret of true love,
And I want the world to know that...
