Remember Your creator
In the days of your youth.
(Repeat 4 times)
#1
See people old and grey,
Hear them say:
'Wish I had been that way
When I was young.
I wasn't like you, you see,
Missed the opportunity,
And now I am old
And wish I was told.'
#2
While you are young and strong
You can sing this song,
You can serve the Lord
With all you have.
And you will have no regrets,
You have done what's best;
You have not forgot, to...
