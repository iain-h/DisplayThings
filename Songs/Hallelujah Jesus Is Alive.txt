Hallelujah! Jesus is alive,
Death has lost its victory
And the grave has been denied;
Jesus lives for ever,
He's alive, he's alive!
#1
He's the Alpha and Omega,
The first and last is he,
The curse of sin is broken
And we have perfect liberty,
The Lamb of God has risen,
He's alive, he's alive!
(Last time)
Hallelujah! Jesus is alive!
