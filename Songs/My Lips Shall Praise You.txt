My lips shall praise you, my great Redeemer;
My heart will worship, Almighty Saviour.
#1
You take all my guilt away,
Turn the darkest night to brightest day;
You are the restorer of my soul.
#2
Love that conquers every fear,
In the midst of trouble you draw near;
You are the restorer of my soul.
#3
You're the source of happiness,
Bringing peace when I am in distress;
You are the restorer of my soul.
