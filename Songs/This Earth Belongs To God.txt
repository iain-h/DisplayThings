This earth belongs to God,
The world, its wealth, and all its people;
He formed the waters wide
And fashioned every sea and shore.
Who may go up the hill of the Lord
And stand in the place of holiness?
Only the one whose heart is pure,
Whose hands and lips are clean.
#2
Lift high your heads, you gates,
Rise up, you everlasting doors,
As here now the King of glory
Enters into full command.
Who is the King, this King of glory?
Where is the throne He comes to claim?
Christ is the King, the Lord of glory,
Fresh from His victory.
#3
Lift high your heads, you gates,
And fling wide open the ancient doors,
For here the King of glory
Takes universal power.
Who is this King, this King of glory,
What is the power by which He reigns?
Christ is the King, His cross of glory,
And by love He rules.
#4
All glory be to God
The Father, Son and Holy Spirit;
From ages past it was,
Is now, and ever more shall be.
