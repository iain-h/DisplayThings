#1
You Take Me By The Hand,
And though there are times I don't understand,
Your love will never fail
And my heart belongs to You.
Even when the rain clouds break
And the cold wind blows all around me,
I will not be put to shame;
Lord, my hope is in Your name.
You will carry me on Your shoulders
And lead me home.
#2
Carry me over troubled waters,
Carry me over stormy seas.
When the skies are dark and heavy,
By Your grace You'll carry me.
Though the way can seem uncertain
Because the time of change has come,
You will carry me on Your shoulders
And lead me home.
