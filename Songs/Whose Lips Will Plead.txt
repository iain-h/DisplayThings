#1
Whose lips will plead
For the people of this land?
Who'll stand in the gap,
And who'll build up the wall,
Before the long day of God's patience is over,
Before the night comes
When His judgement will fall?
#2
And whose eyes will weep
For the people of this land?
And whose hearts will break
For the hearts made of stone,
For those who are walking out intodarkness,
Away from God's love,
Without Christ, so alone?
#3
And whose ears can hear
What the Spirit is saying
To those who are willing
To watch and to pray?
Pray on till God's light
Fills the skies over this land,
The light of revival that brings a new day.
