Because of You, I can be free;
Because of You, I can be me.
Since that day when love broke through,
My life was changed because of You.
#1
You fill my heart with melody,
Salvation is my song.
The way was opened up for me
To know You as my God.
#2
So I will sing for joy, sing for joy,
Sing for joy to You.
Yes, I will sing for joy, sing for joy,
Sing for joy to You.
(Repeat)
