Let my life be like a love song
Let my life be like a love song
Let my life be like a love song
To Your heart
#1
Lord the love You give You give so generously
You were my sacrifice You gave Your life for me
And now I want to give just as I've received
To live a life that shines Your love for those in need
#2
So let justice roll like an endless stream
Flowing through my life to the poor and weak
Let the things I do and words I speak
Reveal the awesome love You have shown to me
