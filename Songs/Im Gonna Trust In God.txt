How great is the love of God,
How steady is His hand
To guide me through this world.
And though I am weak, in Him I stand,
And you will hear me say today,
In faith, I'm gonna trust in God.
#1
I'm Gonna Trust In God,
I'm gonna trust in Jesus
Without shame and without fear.
I'm gonna fix my eyes
On the hope of glory,
For His day is drawing near.
#2
Now when the cares of life
Seem overwhelming,
And my heart is sinking down,
I'm gonna lift my hands
To the One who'll help me,
To the One who holds my crown.
