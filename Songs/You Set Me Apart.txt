#C
That I may dwell in Your house forever,
Lifting up Your name;
Dwell in Your house forevermore.
(Repeat)
#1
You Set Me Apart,
Gave me a new heart,
Filled with compassion
To share Your great love.
Show me Your ways,
I want to know You.
Guide me in truth,
My hope is in You.
#2
I'll hold on to You,
My strength and my refuge.
Whom shall I fear?
I know You are near.
All of my days
I live for You, Lord.
Establish my path,
There's one thing I ask.
#3
Holy Spirit, have Your way.
Sweet anointing, teach our hearts,
Our lives, we pray.
