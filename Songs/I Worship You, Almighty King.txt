We lift our voice and sing,
There's an extravagant praise
That fills our hearts,
For You are Lord and King
And we bless Your name.
We dance for joy and bring
Our adoration to our faithful God,
To You our everything,
We bring extravagant praise.
Sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah.
Sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah.

I worship You, almighty King, the Holy one,
For You alone have filled me with new life.
My greatest Friend, You've redeemed my soul;
You've won my heart with Your great love.
#2
I have tasted of Your goodness
And I've heard of Your fame,
So we enter into Your presence
To praise Your holy name.
#3
You've called me, Lord, to live for You in holiness,
I've been made clean and chosen as Your son.
Through Jesus Christ You've made me whole,
My heart is filled with love for You.
