We shall stand, with our feet on the rock,
Whatever men may say, we'll lift Your name up high.
And we shall walk, through the darkest night.
Setting our faces like flint we'll walk into the light.
#1
Lord You have chosen me for fruitfulness.
To be transformed in to Your likeness.
I'm gonna fight on through, till I see You face to face.
#2
Lord as Your witnesses you've appointed us,
And with Your Holy Spirit anointed us.
And so I'll fight on through, till I see You, face to face.
